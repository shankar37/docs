# Security overview
This page provides an overview of various security controls and mechanisms to safeguard your StarTree deployment and data.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The StarTree Security Manager provides a centralized location for managing access control within your StarTree environment.

StarTree's Security Manager allows you to:
* [Manage access for users and groups](./manage-security/manage-access.mdx)
* [Generate and manage API tokens](./manage-security/manage-api-tokens.mdx)

**Users & groups**
* **Authentication:** User identities are verified through an external [Identity Provider (IDP)](/docs/get-started-with-startree-cloud/byoc/identity-provider) like Okta or Auth0.
* **Authorization:** The RBAC system determines which actions individual users and user groups are permitted to perform within the system. This includes access to resources, data, and operations.

**Service tokens**<br/>
Authentication & authorization: Service tokens are used by automated services. Both authentication and authorization for these tokens are managed by the RBAC system.

**Scope of control:**<br/>
The RBAC system governs access to:
  * Cluster-level operations: This includes actions like modifying cluster configuration, managing resources, and controlling overall system settings.
  * Table-level operations: This encompasses actions such as creating, deleting, querying, and modifying tables within the system.

## Other security controls
* **Data encryption:** Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect its confidentiality and integrity.
* **Least privilege:** The principle of least privilege is applied throughout the system, granting users only the minimum necessary access to perform their duties.
* **Regular security audits and reviews:** Regular security audits and reviews are conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Network security:** Robust network security measures are in place, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure network segmentation.
* **Incident response:** We have well-defined incident response plans to handle security breaches effectively and minimize impact.
