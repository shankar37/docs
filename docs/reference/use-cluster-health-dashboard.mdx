# StarTree Cloud cluster health dashboard

The StarTree Cloud cluster health dashboard provides an overview of Pinot checks, which lets you observe pass/fail statuses and filter checks based on instances or tables. This dashboard offers a holistic view of the overall health of the cluster.

The `ClusterHealthCheckTask` task runs every 20 minutes by default. Dashboard checks are cached and kept in memory, and then overwritten with every run.

To use checks ad-hoc, use these controller API calls:
* `GET - /periodictask/run?taskName=ClusterHealthCheckTask` (to run the checks now)
* `GET - /clusterHealth` (to fetch cluster health)
* `GET - /clusterHealth/list` (to list all available cluster health checks)


## To view the cluster health dashboard

Log into StarTree Cloud and do the following:

1. Click the organization, then select the workspace you want to view monitoring metrics for.
1. Click the **Services** tab.
1. Click the link next to **My Apps**.
1. Click the **Pinot Control Panel** tile.

A dashboard containing a list of checks appears, and indicates whether the check passes or fails, and additional details about the check.


## List of health checks
