# Release Version 0.5.0: Jun-Aug 2022

## Apache Pinot

### Enhanced null value support

Added proper null value support in all Pinot layers for raw and dictionary encoded single value columns, for all data types. 
For more information, see the [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8697) documentation.

### Deduplication support in real-time Pinot table

Users can now push segments to a real-time table, thus simplifying onboarding when ingesting from a hybrid source (real-time and offline). This makes it very easy to bootstrap or backfill a real-time table. For more details, see [the GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8283).

### Upsert Improvements

Added the following enhancements:

* Prevent data corruption when getting out-of-order messages. See [PR #9159](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9159)
* Improve performance when offloading segments. See [PR #8674](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8674) and [PR #9132](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9132) 

### Multi-stage query engine enhancements

Made further progress in implementing full JOIN support as well as supporting existing query constructs with multi-stage engine, including:

* Distributed shuffle joins
* Group by
* Sub-query
* Complex queries using a mix of the above

See [GitHub issue #8260](https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/8260)

For more details, see [V2 Multi-Stage Query Engine documentation](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/developers/advanced/v2-multi-stage-query-engine).


<Callout>
Requires [separate configuration](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/developers/advanced/v2-multi-stage-query-engine) to enable and is in beta release
Feature support is limited to those listed above
No concurrent multi-stage query support
</Callout>

### API for segment reload status

Added a new controller API for checking status of segment reload operation. 
More details in [this PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8828) and [docs](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/users/tutorials/schema-evolution).

### Helix version upgrade to 1.0.4

Upgraded Helix version to 1.0.4 in Pinot.

### Query cancellation support

Added support for cancelling a submitted query by its ID. This is useful to cancel long running queries in order to conserve resources on the Pinot cluster. 
This is controlled by the following config:

* pinot.server.enable.query.cancellation, false by default
* pinot.broker.enable.query.cancellation, false by default

More details [in this PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9171) or read about it in the [docs](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/getting-started/frequent-questions/query-faq#how-do-i-cancel-a-query).

### Declarative support for query options

Added support for declaratively specifying query options in the SQL query string. Example:

```sql
SET skipUpsert = 'false';
SELECT count(*) FROM tbl
```

More details in [this PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9017) and [docs](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/users/user-guide-query/query-options#after-release-0.11.0).

### Pause support for real-time tables

Added support to pause / resume ingestion for a real-time Pinot table. 

More details in [this PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8986). 

### Bloom filter for no dictionary columns

Added support for configuring bloom filter for no dictionary single valued columns in Pinot table config.

### Protobuf decoder

Added Protobuf decoder for realtime ingestion with file or schema registry based descriptor support. 

More details in [this wiki](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/v/release-0.11.0/basics/data-import/pinot-input-formats#protocol-buffers).

### Kafka ingestion from specific period/timestamp

Ability to begin consumption from a specific period (2d ago, 12h ago) or timestamp (in format 2022-08-09T12:31:38.222Z) string.

More details in [PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9193) and [docs](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/data-import/pinot-stream-ingestion/import-from-apache-kafka).


### Minion UI in the Pinot Admin UI

Added Minion tab in Pinot UI, to show more details about task queues, tasks and sub tasks, along with exceptions.

More details in [PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/8978).


### Hide Query Console from Pinot UI

Added a cluster config to hide Query Console from Pinot UI. 
Cluster config to disable can be found [here](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/configuration-reference/cluster).

Now users can perform root-cause analysis in ThirdEye  using a self-serve events UI. Using this users can identify events that caused the anomalous events. Users can upload any type of event (ex: Holidays, Jira events etc using ThirdEye APIs (link))

Example of events that helps with “Root-cause analysis” of an anomalous event in a KPI are:

* Custom events (Ex: A/B test-related specific events)
