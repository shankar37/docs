# Release Version 0.6.0: Feb 2023

## Apache Pinot

### Multi stage enhancements

The multi stage query engine now supports the `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, `IN`, and `NOT IN` clauses.
It also supports left joins, semi joins, and inequality joins.
All functions have now been registered with the Calcite catalog reader.

### V1 query engine enhancements

Added support for isDistinctFrom and isNotDistinctFrom. 
More details in the [pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9312)

### Multi volume

Added capability to tiering storage locally by attaching multiple disks (eg: SSD + HDD). 
More details in [the Pinot documentation](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/operating-pinot/separating-data-storage-by-age/using-multiple-directories).

### Segment level debug 

Added segment level Debug API and UI. 
More details in the [pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9609)

### Consumer record lag 
Added a new API for exposing record based lag during real-time consumption. Currently this is only supported for Kafka data source. 
More details in the [pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9515)


### Custom time boundary for hybrid tables
Added new APIs for configuring a custom time boundary for hybrid Pinot tables as well as a validation API to ensure all segments have finished uploading during offline push (check against ideal state). 
More details in the [pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9356)

### Upserts enhancements
Added enableSnapshot flag in upsertConfig to use snapshot for upsert metadata recovery. This will help achieve TTL (Time To Live) support for primary keys. 
More details in the [Pinot documentation](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/data-import/pinot-stream-ingestion/import-from-apache-kafka#extract-record-headers-as-pinot-table-columns) and [pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9224)


### Extract metadata from stream event header

Added support for using fields within the message envelope as columns in the Pinot schema (eg: key within a Kafka message envelope). 
More details in the [pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9062)

### Segment Reload enhancements
Added ability to change compression type during segment reload. More details in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9454).
In addition, added capability within the Pinot UI to track reload progress. 
More details in [PR-9521](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9521) and [PR-9700](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9700).

### Adaptive Server Selection
**Warning**: This feature is experimental, under development, and turned off by default. We recommend using this feature for **testing purposes only**.

When a query is received, we could use one of the implemented Adaptive Selectors (NumInFlightRequests, Latency, Hybrid) to efficiently route queries to the best server instead of using a naive round robin approach. More details can be found in the [Pinot documentation](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/operating-pinot/tuning/query-routing-using-adaptive-server-selection).

### Frictionless Ingestion

* Automatically infer parquet reader type based on file metadata in case of offline ingestion. More details in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9294)
* Added Spark Job Launcher utility for offline table ingestion within the Pinot admin tool for ease of use. More details in this [PR ](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9288)
* Added continueOnError flag within the Pinot table config. If set to true, any errors from data type or expression transformations are ignored and null / default values are used instead. This is useful when users don’t want the ingestion to stop because of a few bad records. More details in  [PR-9320](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9320) and [PR-9376 ](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9376)

### MergeRollup task on real-time tables
Added support for merging / rolling up segments of a real-time Pinot table. More details in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9890)

### Force commit
Added a new resetConsumption API in the controller to force the current consuming segment in a real-time Pinot table to be committed. More details in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9197)


### Seamless stream change
Added the capability to modify stream properties (for eg: start consuming from a different Kafka topic) without disabling the table. More details in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9289).

### Logging enhancements

* Added a /loggers API endpoint to change logging level at runtime. More details in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9180)
* Added a new API to allow downloading logs from individual components (broker/server) as well as a new controller API to download any remote log. More details in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/9259)
