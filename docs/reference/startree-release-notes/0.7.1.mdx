# Release Version 0.7.1: November 2023

## Significant Apache Pinot updates since last StarTree release

For complete details on Pinot changes, see [Releases](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/releases).

* Skip unparseable records in the CSV reader. To enable, set the `skipUnParseableLines` flag to true ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11487)). 
* Protocol buffer ingestion supports null values with Proto 3 ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11553))
* Upgrade Confluent libraries from 5.5.3 to 7.2.6 ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11753)) 
* Faster real-time table ingestion with updates to the segment builder. To enable, edit the table configuration to set `realtime.segment.flush.enable_column_major` to `true` ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11776))
* Improve alias handling in single-stage engine with multiple fixes to column aliases ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11610))
* Enhance handling of new partitions when using [`StrictReplicaRouting`](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/data-import/dedup#use-strictreplicagroup-for-routing) to prevent "instance unavailable" exceptions ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11585)) 
* Optimize performance in the multi-stage engine:
    * For a single join key and group key scenario, operate directly on the key values without wrappers ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11630)) 
    * Operate on column indexes in multi-stage aggregations to prevent extra conversion steps
    * Avoid converting unnecessary rows in aggregations ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11607)) 
* Enhance segment assignments for upsert tables with more checks to ensure that the conditions required for upsert functionality to work are not violated ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11628)) 
* Fix handling of literals used in aggregation for v2 engine ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11863)) 

### Breaking changes 

* You must now specify the data type of literals in Pinot queries. Before this change, for example, `2022-02-02 22:22:22.123` was automatically treated as a timestamp data type. Now, following standard SQL behavior, use `CAST('2022-02-02 22:22:22.123' AS TIMESTAMP)` instead ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11763)). 
* Change the "forbidden" error to "unauthorized" ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11501))
* Table configurations that point to a different schema name no longer work ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11591)).
* You can no longer change the table state using the `GET` call ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11621)).
* You can no longer create a schema with `NaN` as the default value ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11661)).
* `BigDecimal` responses are now stored as a string with double quotes instead of a number ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11716)).


## Dependencies
* Upgrade to Parquet 1.12.3 ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11337)) 
* Upgrade to Hadoop 3.2.4 ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11369))
* Upgrade to AVRO 1.10.2 ([pull request](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11698)) 

### StarTree extensions for Apache Pinot 

The following updates are available only in StarTree Cloud.

* Improvements to [file ingestion task](https://dev.startree.ai/docs/ingest-data/file-ingestion-task): 
    * Enhancements to batch ingestion using minion to improve atomic ingestion and backfill operations
    * Control size-based segment creation with [`desiredSegmentSize`](https://dev.startree.ai/docs/ingest-data/file-ingestion-task#control-the-ingestion-parallelism) to improve performance
* Automatically tune segment size for segment refresh task without configuring `maxNumRecordsPerTask` and `maxNumRecordsPerSegment`. Size-based tuning helps make predictable segment sizes and avoid memory- or size- related exceptions 
* Validation is stricter for using sync mode in conjunction with other tasks. You can no longer schedule the segment refresh task at the same time as sync mode.
* Separate RocksDB log from server logs to improve debugging experience and allow you to set different retention and rollover policies
* Improve Kafka logs by changing the following classes to error-level:
    * `KafkaConsumer`
    * `AppInfoParser`
    * `ConsumerConfig`
* Enhancements to upsert tables: 	
    * Correctly track primary key count and add corresponding metrics
    * Improve stability during deletion
* Improve performance and navigation in broker and server Grafana dashboards
* Move to Google Trust Services Certificate Authority to improve certification management

## Data Manager

* Improve data sampling from Kafka topics with large numbers of partitions by preventing "no data" error in preview 
* Automate Google Cloud Platform (GCP) credentials in Data Manager so you can ingest instead of having to contact StarTree support
* Improve error messages to aid troubleshooting

## ThirdEye

* Improve loading time for multi-dimension alerts and dashboard statistics
* Simplified alert creation with advanced anomaly detection and tuning options, reducing complexity of data patterns and seasonality
