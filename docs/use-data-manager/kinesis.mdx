# AWS Kinesis connector

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Kinesis is a fully managed service that stores and processes large streams of data in real time.

StarTree customers can use the Amazon Kinesis connector to create a table in Apache Pinot. As soon as the integration is set up, StarTree will automatically start to ingest data from the specified Kinesis data stream.

To begin, from the StarTree Data Manager overview page, click **Create a dataset**. Then, on the Select Connection Type page, click **Amazon Kinesis**.

## Connect StarTree to Amazon Kinesis

Use one of the following methods to create a connection to AWS Kinesis:

* AWS access and secret keys
* AWS cross-account Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles

Both of these options require you to configure an AWS IAM policy first. 

## Configure AWS IAM policy

1. Open the AWS IAM dashboard, click **Policies**, and click **Create policy**.

1. Click the **JSON** tab and create the following policy, replacing _my-stream-name_ with the stream name that you will use to establish the connection.
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kinesis:ListShards",
                "kinesis:DescribeStream",
                "kinesis:GetRecords",
                "kinesis:GetShardIterator"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:kinesis:*:*:stream/my-stream-name"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kinesis:ListStreams"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

1. Provide the **Policy name**, such as `kinesis-my-stream-policy`, and click **Create policy**.

Select one of the connection creation options to continue.

## Option 1: Create a connection using access and secret keys

You will need the following information to create a connection with Amazon Kinesis when using your AWS access key and a secret key pair.

* **Region:** The AWS region where the Kinesis stream resides. you can find this information in the Kinesis dashboard.
* **Access & Secret Key:** You can generate AWS Account and Access Keys in the [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam).


### Create an AWS access and secret key pair

If you do not have an access key and secret key pair, follow these steps to generate one.

1. Open the [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam), click **Users**, and click **Add users**.

1. Enter a **User name**, such as `startree-my-stream-user`, and click **Next**.

1. Under **Permission options**, select **Attach policies directly**.

1. Use search to find the policy name you created earlier, it was `kinesis-my-stream-policy` in our example. Click **Next** and click **Create user**.

1. Return to the AWS IAM Dashboard, click **Users**, then select the user name that you just created, like `startree-my-stream-user` in our example.

1. Select the **Security credentials** tab and click **Create access key**.

1. Click **Application running on an AWS compute service**, click **Next**, and click **Create access key**.

1. Copy the **Access key** and the **Secret access key** from here and enter them in the Data Manager.

Continue in the **Create dataset** section.


## Option 2: Create a connection using AWS IAM roles

You will need the following information to create a connection with Amazon Kinesis when using AWS IAM Roles:

* **Region:** The AWS region where the Kinesis stream resides. You can find this information in the Amazon Kinesis dashboard.
* **IAM Role ARN:** The Customer-provided IAM Role ARN that will be assumed by the StarTree Data Plane.

### Create an AWS IAM role

If you do not have an AWS IAM role, follow these steps to generate one.

1. Find the following information. You will need it in later steps.
    * **StarTree Account ID** and **External ID** from the Data Manager UI.
    * **StarTree environment name** from the StarTree Cloud Portal.
    ![StarTree environment name in the StarTree cloud portal](/img/startree_environment_name.png)
1. Check your Security Token Service (STS) configuration 
    * Open the [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) and click **Account settings**. 
    * If the **Security Token Service (STS)** is not currently in **Active** status for the region that you have Kinesis stream, set it to **Active**.

1. In the AWS IAM console, click **Roles** in the left menu bar, click **Create role**.

1. In the AWS IAM console, click **AWS account** for **Trusted entity type**.
    * If your Kinesis stream and StarTree Data Plane run on the same account you are currently using to access the AWS IAM console, click **This Account**.
    * If your Kinesis stream and StarTree Data Plane use a different account, from the StarTree Data Manager copy the **StarTree AWS Account** information and paste it into the **Another AWS Account** field. Then copy the **External ID** and paste it into the **External ID** field.

1. Use search to find the policy name you created earlier, it was `kinesis-my-stream-policy` in our example. Click **Next**.

1. Fill the Role details.
    * **Role name:** Enter a role name, such as `startree-my-stream-role`.
    * **Tags:** Enter a key-value pair.
      * **Key:** `startree-environment-name`
      * **Value:** This is the **StarTree environment name** found in the cloud portal from an earlier step.

1. Click **Create role**. Navigate to the Summary page. Copy the **ARN** field and enter it into the **IAM Role ARN** field in the Data Manager UI. Click **Create Connection**.
