# Kafka connector

Kafka is an open-source distributed data streaming platform designed to handle high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and real-time data streaming.

Use the Kafka connector to create a table in Apache Pinot by mapping it to a particular topic.
StarTree automatically begins to consume data from the connected topic in Kafka.

## Connect StarTree Cloud to Kafka

To connect StarTree to Kafka, complete the following procedures as needed:

- If you're using SSL, complete [prerequisites for SSL](#prerequisites-for-ssl), and then
[create a dataset in StarTree Cloud](#create-a-dataset-in-startree-cloud).

   <Callout type="note">
   **Note:** To update an SSL certificate, see [Renew Kafka SSL certificates](#renew-kafka-ssl-certificates).
   </Callout>

- If you're not using SSL, go to [create a dataset in StarTree Cloud](#create-a-dataset-in-startree-cloud).

### Prerequisites for SSL

To use SSL encryption, you must do the following:

- Obtain the bootstrap server endpoint (for the Pinot broker URL)
- Obtain the server certificate, the client certificate, and the client key

1. To locate the bootstrap server information to add the broker URL, open the `server.properties` file.

   <Callout type="note">
   **Note:** The location of the server.properties file varies depending on the operating system being used. Contact your server administrator if you cannot locate this file.
   </Callout>

2. Copy the entire line after bootstrap.servers that contain the list of bootstrap servers and ports.
   For example, copy `hostname1:9092, hostname2:9092` from the line below:
   ```bash
    bootstrap.servers: hostname1:9092, hostname2:9092
    ```
3. If you're using SSL for authentication, obtain the server certificate, the client certificate, and the client key.
	- For **Apache Kafka**, click the **Obtain SSL details for Apache Kafka** tab
   - For **Aiven Kafka**, click the **Obtain SSL details for Aiven Kafka** tab

    ## Obtain SSL details for Apache Kafka
    To obtain your Certificate Authority (CA) (server certificate), the client certificate, and the client key for Apache Kafka, complete the following steps:
    1. Optional if you already have a Certificate Authority (CA) to sign. To create a CA, run the following command on the Kafka server command line:
       ```bash
       openssl req -new -x509 -keyout ca-key -out ca-cert -days {validity}
       ```
    2. To generate the client certificate and client key, do the following:

       a. Enter the following command on the Kafka server command line:
           ```bash
              keytool -keystore {key_store_name}.jks -alias {key_store_name_alias} -keyalg RSA -validity {validity} -genkey
           ```

               <Callout type="note">
                **Note:** The alias is just a shorter name for the key store. The same alias needs to be reused throughout the steps.
                   Remember your passwords for each keystore or truststore to use later.
               </Callout>

       b. Provide the answers to questions that are displayed on the interactive prompt. For the question What is your first and last name?, enter the CN for your certificate.

               <Callout type="note">
                **Note:** The Common Name (CN) must match the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server to ensure that StarTree connects to the correct server.
                   Refer to this page to find the FQDN based on the server type.
               </Callout>

    3. To add the CA to the broker's truststore, run the following on the Kafka server command line:
           ```bash
              keytool -keystore {broker_trust_store}.jks -alias CARoot -importcert -file ca-cert
           ```
    4. To sign the certificates with the CA file, do the following on the Kafka server command line:

        a. Export the certificate from the keystore:
           ```bash
              keytool -keystore {key_store_name}.jks -alias {key_store_name_alias} -certreq -file cert-file
           ```
       b. Sign the certificate with the CA:
           ```bash
              openssl x509 -req -CA ca-cert -CAkey ca-key -in cert-file -out cert-signed -days {validity} -CAcreateserial -passin pass:{ca-password}
           ```
       c. Add the certificates back to the keystore:
           ```bash
              keytool -keystore {key_store_name}.jks -alias CARoot -importcert -file ca-cert

              keytool -keystore {key_store_name}.jks -alias {key_store_name_alias} -importcert -file cert-signed
           ```
       d. Extract the client certificate key from keystore
           a. Convert the keystore file from its existing `.jks` format to the PKCS12 (.p12) format for interoperability.
              To do this, enter the following command in the Kafka server command line:
              ```bash
             keytool -v -importkeystore -srckeystore
             {key_store_name}.jks -srcalias
             {key_store_name_alias} -destkeystore
             {key_store_name}.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12
              ```
           b. Extract the client certificate key into a `.pem` file (the format StarTree Cloud uses):
              ```bash
             openssl pkcs12 -in {key_store_name}.p12 -nocerts -nodes > cert-key.pem
              ```
           c. Go to the Kafka server folder with the Kafka truststore and keystore, and upload the following files to StarTree Cloud:
              - Client certificate: `cert-signed`
              - Client key: `cert-key.pem`
              - CA (server certificate): `ca-cert

    ### Obtain SSL details for Aiven Kafka
    To obtain the server certificate, the client certificate, and the client key for Aiven Kafka, complete the following steps:
    1. Log in to the Aiven Console, and then select your Apache Kafka service.
    2. In the Overview section, find the Connection information, and then copy the following:
       - **Access key** to use for the Client key
       - **Access certificate** to use for the Client certificate
       - **CA certificate** to use for the Server certificate
       For more detail, see the [Aiven documentation](https://aiven.io/docs/products/kafka/howto/keystore-truststore#access-service-certificates).
    3. To configure your Aiven Kafka using the SSL authentication type, open StarTree Data Manager, and [create a dataset in StarTree Cloud](#create-a-dataset-in-startree-cloud).
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Renew Kafka SSL certificates

    To renew your Apache Kafka or Aiven Kafka SSL certificates, do the following:
    1. Update the SSL certificate entries in your Table configuration using Pinot APIs.
    2. Use the `forceCommit` API to flush out the current consuming segments and start new Kafka consumers. The SSL certificates are updated.

### Create a dataset in StarTree Cloud


1. On the StarTree Data Manager overview page, click **Create a dataset**. Then, on the Select Connection Type page, click **Kafka**.

2. Enter the following information:

    - **Broker URL:** You can find this information from your Kafka cluster. The broker URL contains the port number at the end.
    - **Authentication Type:**
        - **Default:** Select this option if you've deployed StarTree Cloud BYOC and Kafka in the same VPC.
           In this case, connect to your Kafka cluster without any authentication. When selecting this option,
           no further information is needed to create a connection between StarTree Data Manager and the Kafka broker.
        - **SASL:** SASL is a framework for data security and authentication. Choose this option to ensure only authenticated actors can connect
        to the Kafka cluster. This option supports both unencrypted and encrypted data.
        Enter the following information when selecting this option:
              - **Security Protocol:** Your chosen communication type, select from the following available options:
              - **SASL_PLAINTEXT:** The communication between the client (StarTree Data Manager in this case) and Kafka broker is not encrypted.
              - **SASL_SSL:** The communication between the client (StarTree Data Manager in this case) and Kafka broker is encrypted.
        - **SASL Mechanism:** This is the authentication mechanism and not coupled with security protocol. Select from the following options:
          - **PLAIN**: In this mode, authentication credentials are exchanged between StarTree Data Manager and Kafka broker as entered in the UI.
          - **SCRAM-SHA-256**: In this case, the authentication is established by passing a 32-byte hash token which is generated based on the username and password.
          - **SCRAM-SHA-512**: In this case, the authentication is established by passing a 64-byte hash token which is generated based on the username and password.
        - **Username:** Username to connect to the broker.
        - **Password:** Password associated with the username to connect to broker.
        - *Advanced Options** are available if you are using a schema registry. This is only supported for Confluent Cloud currently.
           The schema registry stored in other services, for example, AWS Glue and others, is not supported. For Confluent Cloud, enter the following information:
              - **Schema Registry URL**
              - **Username:**
              - **Password:**
        - **SSL Setup:** SSL can be set up in two different ways. One is using an open certificate authority like 'Letâ€™s Encrypt' and the other is using a commercial certificate
        authority. To set up SSL, you need a Server certificates (CA), client certificates, and a client key. If you haven't already obtained these, see [Prerequisites for SSL](#prerequisites-for-ssl).
3. To configure dataset details, enter a dataset description and select an existing topic name.
4. From the second drop-down list, select the appropriate **Data Format** (supported data formats include):
      * Avro
      * JSON
      * Parquet
      * protobuf
   Note: Schema registry is required for AVRO and Protobuf data formats. If youâ€™ve not configured it already, go back to the previous screen to provide schema registry information in the Connection details.

5. (Optional) In the **Record reader config** field, provide additional details about the source schema for your data format. For more information, see [Configure record reader](#configure-record-reader).

6. Data Modeling
   - Configure Columns: You can change the schema, add columns, remove columns, and configure the time columns. Along with this, you can create the new transformed column using defined mapping functions.
   - Configure Pinot Time Column

7. Configure encoding types and indexes to the appropriate columns to improve query performance.
8. Configure Tenant-related additional configurations such as broker and server tenant, data retention period, and the primary key for upsert.
9. Review and Submit: Check the dataset and connection details. When ready, click **Create Dataset**.
