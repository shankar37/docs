# Editing Schema and Table Config

Editing the schema or table configuration is necessary in the following scenarios:
1. Adding a new column
2. Modifying an existing column
3. Changing the retention period
4. Updating the replication factor
5. Adjusting the ingestion task schedule
6. Adding a transformation function to columns
7. Modifying the partitioning logic

StarTreeâ€™s Data Manager offer built-in capabilities to edit the Schema and Table config JSON. Let's go through the step-by-step guide:
1. Go to a particular Dataset that you want to edit.
2. Click on `Edit` on right top corner. You'll enter into edit mode for Schema on the left and Table Config on the right.
3. Edit the required configuration and save it.

Please note that editing the configuration will trigger a segment reload to automatically apply the new settings, so manual intervention is not required.
