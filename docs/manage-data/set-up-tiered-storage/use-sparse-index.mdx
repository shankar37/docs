# Use Sparse Index

## Introduction

Apache Pinot supports different types of indexes such as forward indexes, Bloom filters, hash and sorted inverse dense
indexes, or range inverted indexes.
Sparse indexes are a hybrid between inverted indexes and Bloom filters designed to speed up queries that filter results
using equality (or IN) over a column with very high cardinality, such as columns storing hundreds of thousands of random
values, UUIDs, or public IPs.
They are a StarTree extension that shine particularly when [tiered storage](./) is used.

## Description
Sparse indexes group rows into contiguous chunks of a predefined size and classify column values into a fixed number of
_partitions_ using one or many _hash functions_ (also called _mappers_).
Finally, it creates a pseudo-inverted index between each _partition_ and each _chunk_.

When a filter such as where `column = constant` is used, the sparse index looks for the partition where the `constant`
belongs.
Then it uses the pseudo-inverted index to obtain the _chunks_ where this partition is found.
These are the only groups of rows where the predicate may evaluate to true, so this information is used to optimize the
IO access.

This method is useful when the segment is stored locally, but it is particularly notable when using [tiered storage](./).
In this case, instead of downloading the whole forward index, Pinot only downloads the interesting _chunks_.
This significantly reduces the number of bytes downloaded from the cloud object storage.

## Enable sparse indexes
To enable the sparse index StarTree extension, set `pinot.server.instance.index.sparse.enabled` to `true` in the server configuration.
One way to do so is to use the `POST /cluster/configs` API from Swagger.

After adding new configurations, restart existing servers.
<Callout type="note">
If the`pinot.server.instance.index.sparse.enabled` property is **not** set to `true`, you can create sparse indexes, but won't be able to use them during the query phase.

## Create sparse indexes

Sparse indexes has to be declared in the table configuration, specifically in the `fieldConfigList` section.
For example, the json above defines a sparse index in the `deviceId` column:

```json
{
  "tableName": "example",
  //...
  "fieldConfigList": [
    //...
    {
      "name": "deviceId",
      "indexes": {
        "sparse": {
          "chunkSize": 8192,
          "partitions": 1000,
          "hashFunctionCount": 10
        }
      }
    }
    //...
  ]
}
```

Sparse indexes support several configuration options:

| Property          | Type | Default | Recommended                      | Affect size             | Description                              |
|-------------------|------|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| chunkSize         | int  | 8192    | 1 to 16384                       | inverse, but sub linear | The chunk size. It must be a power of 2. |
| partitions        | int  | 1000    | Depends on numbers unique values | linearly                | The number of partitions used.           |
| hashFunctionCount | int  | 10      | between 1 to 20                  | linearly                | How many partition mappers are used.     |

### `chunkSize`
Specifies the number of documents that form a chunk.
This option must be a power of 2.
The smaller the chunk, the fewer documents the engine evaluates, which may reduce the query latency.
Very small values may also slightly increase the size of the index, which may increase the query latency, especially
when using tiered storage.
Empirical results recommend values between 1 and 16384.

### `partitions`
Specifies how many partitions the values are classified into.
The recommended value depends on the expected cardinality: the more unique values, the higher it should be.
The size of the index grows linearly with this value, so doubling the number of partitions almost doubles the size of
the index.

### `hashFunctionCount`
Specifies the number of function mappers used.
Empirical results recommend values between 1 and 20.
Larger values will increase the selectivity of the index, possibly reducing the scan part, but very high values may
slightly increase the latency.
Also, the size of the index grows linearly with this value, so doubling the number of partitions almost doubles the size
of the index.

### Extra options
The following configurations should only be used in extremely unique use cases. Typically, we do not recommend configuring these options:

#### `seedGenerator`
An integer used as a seed to later generate seeds used to generate each hash function.
Any integer value is valid, and they produce similar values and do not affect the index size.
This option should only be defined in the strange case that collisions are very frequent in one or many hash functions.

#### `mapperId`
A string that identifies the type of hash function used.
At this moment, the only valid value is `murmur`.
