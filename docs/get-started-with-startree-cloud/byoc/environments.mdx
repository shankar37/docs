# Environments

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout type="info">
In this guide we're going to learn how to create an environment. You will need to have configured a <a href="cloud-provider" className="underline">cloud provider</a>.
</Callout>

Users of an organization may create as many environments as permitted by the quotas allowed by the cloud subscription
reference attached the environment

![View organization](/img/org-env-list-new.png) _View organization_

Click on **Create environment** and choose a name for the environment:

![Choose environment name](/img/new-environment.png) _Choose environment name_

Once you've entered a name, click **Next**.

## Select cloud provider

You will see the following screen, where you can configure the cloud provider:

![Configure cloud provider](/img/configure-environment.png) _Configure cloud provider_

Select the cloud provider created in the [cloud provider](cloud-provider.md) guide. You'll also need to choose a region
and availability zones for your StarTree Cloud cluster.

<Callout>You should select **at least two** availability zones to ensure maximum up time.</Callout>

Then click **Next**.

## Configure networking

You will now see the following screen, where you can adjust the network settings:

<p>
  <img src="/img/environment-networking.png" width="80%" alt="Configure networking" />
  <em>Configure networking</em>
</p>

You'll need to configure the IP ranges to make sure that they don't conflict with other services running in your AWS
estate, but if you don't have anything else running you can go ahead with the defaults. Click **Next** once you've made
any changes.

## Configure security

You will now see the following screen, where you can control access to the StarTree platform:

<p>
  <img src="/img/configure-security.png" width="80%" alt="Configure security" />
  <em>Configure security</em>
</p>

Click **Next**.

## Configure Pinot cluster

You will now see the following screen, where you can control access to the StarTree platform:

<p>
  <img src="/img/configure-pinot-cluster.png" width="80%" alt="Configure Pinot cluster" />
  <em>Configure Pinot cluster</em>
</p>

Enter a cluster name, which must only contain alpha numeric characters.

If you want your Pinot cluster to be accessible externally, set **Routing** to public, otherwise leave it as private.

For a production use case you'll want to select a **HA Cluster**. You can then configure the number of Pinot
Controllers, Pinot Servers, Pinot Brokers, and Pinot Zookeeper instances. If you're doing experiments or a proof of
concept, a **Dev Cluster** should be sufficient.

Once you're happy with your selections, click **Next** to do one final check of all your config, or **Skip** to only
review the environment config.

## Review config

You will then see this screen if you clicked **Skip**:

<p>
  <img src="/img/review-config-skip.png" width="80%" alt="Review config (skip)" />
  <em>Review config (skip)</em>
</p>

Or this screen if you clicked **Next**:

<p>
  <img src="/img/review-config.png" width="80%" alt="Review config" />
  <em>Review config</em>
</p>

Once you've reviewed the config, click **Finish**.

## View Environment

The environment will now start deploying and it will probably take about 15-20 minutes, so now's the time to get a â˜•.

Once it's been created you will see the environment displayed under the organization, as shown in the screenshot below:

To see the environment, click on its name, which will lead to the following screen:

![View environment](/img/view-environment.png) _View environment_

Click on the **Services** tab. There are several actions that you can take next:

- To configure a data source that you want to load into the Pinot cluster, click on the link next to the second **My
  Apps** label. You can learn more about the StarTree Data Manager in the
  [Data Manager guide](../../use-data-manager.md).
- To go straight to the [Pinot Data Explorer](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/components/exploring-pinot), click on
  the link next to the cluster name.
- To see apps available to run against your Pinot cluster, click on the link next to the first **My Apps** label.
