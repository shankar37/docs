import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout type="info">
In this guide we're going to learn how to add an identity provider to a StarTree Cloud account. You will need to
have created an <a href="/docs/get-started-with-startree-cloud/startree-cloud-byoc/organizations" className="underline">organization</a> and <a href="/docs/get-started-with-startree-cloud/startree-cloud-byoc/users" className="underline">user</a>.
</Callout>

StarTree Cloud supports GitHub, GCP, and OIDC (Ex: OKTA) as identity providers. The identity provider is used to secure
access to an [environment](environments.md).

From the organizations screen, click the **Identity Providers** tab and then **Create identity provider** in the top
right. You will see the following screen:

<p>
  <img src="/img/identity-provider.png" width="60%" alt="Select Identity Provider" />
  <em>Select Identity Provider</em>
</p>

Select your preferred identity provider and then generate the credentials by following the instructions below.

## GitHub
After selecting the **Github** identity provider, you'll see the following screen:

<p>
    <img src="/img/identity-provider.png" width="60%" alt="Select GitHub as Identity Provider" />
    <em>Select GitHub as Identity Provider</em>
</p>

On a new browser tab, navigate to the [Register a new OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) page.
You should see the following:

![Register OAuth application](/img/github-register-oauth-application.png)
*Register OAuth application*

Choose an application name.
Now, type `https://www.startree.cloud` into the **Homepage URL** field and `http://identity.<env\>.<org\>.startree.cloud/` into the **Authorization callback URL** field.

Click **Register application**. 

You will now be redirected to a page that describes your OAuth application.

Copy **Client ID** and paste it into the **Client Id** field on the StarTree Cloud UI.
Now click on the **Generate a new client secret** button, copy the generated secret, and paste it into the **Client Secret** field on the StarTree Cloud UI.
Finally, enter your **Organization name** and click on **Create**.

Your identity provider has now been created.

## Google
After selecting the **Google** identity provider, you'll see the following screen:

<p>
    <img src="/img/identity-provider-gcp.png" width="60%" alt="Select Google as Identity Provider" />
    <em>Select Google as Identity Provider</em>
</p>

On a new browser tab, navigate to the [Credentials page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).

1. Click **Create credentials > OAuth client ID**.
2. Select the **Web application** application type.
3. Name your OAuth 2.0 client and click **Create**

Copy **Client ID** and paste it into the **Client Id** field on the StarTree Cloud UI.
Copy **Client Secret** and paste it into the **Client Secret** field on the StarTree Cloud UI.

Your identity provider has now been created.

## OIDC
After selecting the **OIDC** identity provider, you'll see the following screen:

</p>

1. Specify identify provider name
