# Connect Superset to StarTree Cloud

To connect Superset to StarTree Cloud, do the following:

1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
2. [Obtain SQLAlchemy URI in clients page](#obtain-sqlalchemy-uri-in-clients-page)
3. [Add the SQLAlchemy URI in Superset](#add-the-sqlalchemy-uri-in-superset)

## Prerequisites

- Have a running StarTree cluster. [Sign up for a StarTree Cloud trial (opens in a new tab)](https://www.startree.ai/saas-signup).
- Have a running Superset instance. For more information about how install and deploy Superset, see [What is Apache Superset? (opens in a new tab)](https://superset.apache.org/docs/intro).
- Make sure your Superset instance has the Pinot database driver installed, which is compatible with StarTree Cloud. For more information, see how to [install a database driver for Superset (opens in a new tab)](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/installing-database-drivers).

## Obtain SQLAlchemy URI in clients page

If you are running on a StarTree Free Tier Cluster:
1. Navigate to the trial home page by going to [startree.cloud/new-user](https://startree.cloud/new-user)
2. Click on **Configure Clients** to go to the clients page
3. Click on **Superset in the client** options and generate an *API token* and the *SQLAlchemy URI*

If you are running on a paid StarTree Cluster:

2. Click on the **Pinot API Tokens** button
3. On the API Tokens page, select **Clients** from the left hand sidebar
4. Click on **Superset** in the client options and generate an *API token* and the *SQLAlchemy URI*
