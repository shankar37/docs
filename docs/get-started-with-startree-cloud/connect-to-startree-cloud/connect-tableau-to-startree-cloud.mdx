# Connect Tableau to StarTree Cloud

To connect either Tableau Desktop or Tableau Server to your StarTree Cloud instance of Apache Pinot, you need the following:

 * **JDBC driver (JAR file)**
 * **Tableau connector (TACO file)**

## How to install and launch Tableau

1. Build or download the JDBC driver.
	You can build this from the [source code](https://github.com/apache/pinot/tree/master/pinot-clients/pinot-jdbc-client) or you can [download](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/pinot/pinot-jdbc-client/) one that is already built. In either case, you must use the shaded jar, which will have a filename that includes `shaded`, as in `pinot-jdbc-client-1.0.0-shaded.jar`.

1. Copy the JDBC driver JAR to the Tableau drivers directory.
    - On Mac: `~/Library/Tableau/Drivers/`
    - On Windows: `C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers`

1. Download the [TACO file](../../../assets/files/ai.startree.pinot-0.13.0-SNAPSHOT.taco).

1. Copy the TACO file to the connectors directory.
    - On Mac: `~/Library/Tableau/Connectors/` 
    - On Windows: `C:\Users\[user]\Documents\My Tableau Repository\Connectors`

1. Launch Tableau.
	You may need to launch Tableau Desktop with connector signature verification disabled using one of these methods. See **Signing the TACO file** for information about how to successfully launch with signature verification.
		- On Mac: `/Applications/Tableau\ Desktop\ <version>.app/Contents/MacOS/Tableau -DDisableVerifyConnectorPluginSignature=true` 
		- On Windows: `tableau.exe -DConnectPluginsPath=C:\tableau_connector`

## Use the Tableau connector

1. Select the connector from the list of installed connectors.

2. Configure the connection to Pinot and connect.

3. Once you are connected, you will be able to see the data from your data source and can begin to query.

## Signing the TACO file

Maven is configured to sign the `.taco` file during the package stage.

Signing requires the following maven properties:
* taco.signing.keystore - The path to the `.jks` file containing the code-signing certificate (defaults to `taco.jks`)
    * NOTE: the `taco.jks` in this directory is just a placeholder. It DOES NOT contain a valid certificate and must be replaced with a valid `.jks` file when actually signing the `.taco` for distribution
* taco.signing.alias - The alias for the keystore entry that contains the private key needed to generate the signature (defaults to `alias`)
* taco.signing.storepass - The password for the keystore (defaults to `storepass`)
* taco.signing.keypass - The password for the keystore entry (defaults to empty)

For example, to build a signed `.taco` file, use:
* `mvn package -Dtaco.signing.keystore=taco.jks -Dtaco.signing.alias=pinotkeyalias -Dtaco.signing.storepass=tacostorepass -Dtaco.signing.keypass=tacokeypass`

To automate the building and signing of the `.taco`, use secrets in a GitHub action to run the build with the properties configured from values stored in the secrets.
