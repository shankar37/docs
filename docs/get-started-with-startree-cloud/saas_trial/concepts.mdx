# StarTree SaaS Cloud concepts

## What is StarTree Cloud?

StarTree Cloud provides managed hosting for Apache Pinot on all major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP and Azure).
Pinot can ingest directly from streaming data sources, such as Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis, 
and also ingest from batch data sources such as Hadoop HDFS, Amazon S3, Azure ADLS, and Google Cloud Storage.
To learn more about Pinot, see the [Apache Pinot documentation](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/).

Use StarTree Cloud to provision multiple Apache Pinot clusters, ingest data from real-time and batch data sources, 
and run analytics workloads with ultra-low latency. With StarTree Cloud, you'll discover timely insights from your data 
that help you make informed business decisions. StarTree Cloud also includes StarTree Data Manager (for data ingestion) 
and StarTree ThirdEye (for anomaly detection).

## What is StarTree Data Manager?

The Data Manager UI makes it easy to get your data into StarTree Cloud. To learn more about Data Manager, 
see [the Data Manager documentation](docs/concepts/what-is-startree/about-startree-data-manager.md).

## What is StarTree ThirdEye?

StarTree ThirdEye is an anomaly detection, monitoring, and interactive root-cause analysis platform that helps you
identify and predict anomalous behavior in real-time, over massive rapidly-changing datasets. 
ThirdEye provides an interactive root-cause analysis experience, highlighting historical patterns that are impossible to 
track manually.
