# Custom policy cofiguration

A policy configuration is a collection of one or more statement objects, each containing: 
* A description of the policy statement
* One or more [actions](./actions.mdx) that the policy statement applies to
* The resources that the policy statement is applied to, identified using the [SRN format](#identifying-resources-using-srns)
* The effect of the policy statement (`allow` or `deny`)

Here’s an example of a policy that allows querying a table called “myTable”:

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "statements": [
    {
      "description": "Sample policy - Query a given table, deny everything else",
      "resources": [
        "srn2:cluster#myCluster:table#myTable"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "actions": [
        "query"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<callout type="info">
A few important things to note:<br/>
* Within a policy, **deny statements take precedence** regardless of their location in the policy.<br/>
* If actions aren’t explicitly specified, then all actions are implicitly included in the statement (the equivalent of writing `“actions”: “*”`).<br/>
* If the effect isn’t explicitly specified, then `deny` is implicitly applied (the equivalent of writing `“effect”: “deny”`).<br/>
</callout>

You can find additional examples of policy configurations below.

## Identifying resources using SRNs
A StarTree Resource Name (SRN) is a unique identifier for any resource within your StarTree environment. It follows a standardized format that makes it easy to understand and use.

### SRNv2 format
The basic format of an SRNv2 is: `srn2:<resource-type>#<resource-id>`.
For example: srn2:cluster#myCluster identifies the cluster called “myCluster”.
Some resources may have a more complex format to represent hierarchical relationships.

### Constructing an SRNv2 string
Each SRNv2 string starts with the prefix `srn2:`, followed by the resource type and then the resource identifier. A simple SRNv2 would follow this format: `srn2:resource-type#resource-id`

Since resources in StarTree are hierarchical, the SRNv2 string can include any number of levels of hierarchy. An SRNv2 with two levels of hierarchy would look like this: `srn2:resource-type#resource-id:sub-resource-type#sub-resource-id`

Commonly used resource types include: environment, cluster, workspace, and table.

<callout>Hierarchy levels can be omitted. For example, you can write a policy that applies to all tables called “myTable” across the entire environment by omitting the cluster resource type. Alternatively, you can explicitly include all clusters by adding `cluster#*` in the SRN.</callout>

## Examples of policy configurations

### System Administrator
A System Administrator can perform all actions on any resource in the environment.<br/>
(The `system-admin` policy is predefined in StarTree, so you won't need to define it yourself. We're just showing it here as an example.)

```json
{
  "Version": "v1",
  "PolicyName": "SystemAdministrator",
  "Statements": [
    {
      "Description": "Can do everything in an environment",
      "Resources": [
        "*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Actions": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pinot Administrator
A Pinot administrator can perform all actions in a Pinot cluster

```json
{
  "Version": "v1",
  "PolicyName": "PinotAdministrator",
  "Statements": [
    {
      "Description": "Allow all actions on 'myCluster' Pinot cluster, and all tables in the cluster",
      "Resources": [
        "srn2:cluster#myCluster",
        "srn2:cluster#myCluster:table#*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Actions": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The same policy can also be written like this:
```json
{
  "Version": "v1",
  "PolicyName": "PinotAdministrator",
  "Statements": [
    {
      "Description": "Allow all actions on 'myCluster' Pinot cluster, including all resources in the hierarchy under myCluster.",
      "Resources": [
        "srn2:cluster#myCluster:*#*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Actions": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pinot Table Admin
A Pinot table admin can perform any actions on a table
```json
{
  "Version": "v1",
  "PolicyName": "PinotTableAdmin",
  "Statements": [
    {
      "Description": "Allow all actions on 'myTable' table",
      "Resource": "srn2:cluster#my-cluster:table#myTable",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Actions": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pinot Table Reader
A Pinot table reader can perform any read-only operation on a given table.
```json
{
  "Version": "v1",
  "PolicyName": "PinotTableReader",
  "Statements": [
    {
      "Description": "Allow any read-only operation on a Pinot table",
      "Resource": "srn2:cluster#myCluster:table#myTable",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Actions": [
        "Query",
        "GetInstancePartitions",
        "GetConsumingSegmentsInfo",
        "GetStats",
        ...,
        ...,
        ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
* For a full list of available actions, see [Actions](./actions.mdx)

### Pinot Table Query
This policy allows querying a given Pinot table.
```json
{
  "Version": "v1",
  "PolicyName": "PinotTableReader",
  "Statements": [
    {
      "Description": "Allow querying a Pinot table",
      "Resource": "srn2:cluster#myCluster:table#myTable",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Actions": [
        "Query"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Using wildcards
Wildcards provide flexibility to leverage naming conventions used in your organization. 

In this example, the policy will:
* Allow all actions on tables with the prefix “Test”
* Allow queries on tables with the prefix “Prod”
* Deny deletes for all tables

```json
{
  "Version": "v1",
  "PolicyName": "DataScientist",
  "Statements": [
    {
      "Description": "Query tables with the prefix 'Prod'",
      "Resource": "srn2:cluster#*:table#Prod*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Actions": [
        "Query"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Description": "All actions on tables with the prefix 'Test'",
      "Resource": "srn2:cluster#*:table#Test*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Actions": [
        "*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Description": "Deny dropping tables and pausing consumption on all tables",
      "Resource": "srn2:cluster#*:table#*",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Actions": [
        "Delete*",
        "PauseConsumption"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
