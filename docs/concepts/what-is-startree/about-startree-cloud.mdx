# StarTree Cloud

StarTree Cloud provides managed hosting for Apache Pinot on all major cloud platforms, including AWS, GCP, and Azure. StarTree Cloud offers public SaaS (software-as-a-service) and private BYOC deployment options. For more information about our public or private SaaS offering, [schedule a demo](https://startree.ai/demo) with our StarTree solutions architect team. Or, [get started with a free 30-day trial](../../get-started-with-startree-cloud/saas_trial).

StarTree Cloud lets you provision Apache Pinot clusters of different sizes, ingest data from real-time and batch data sources, and run analytics workloads with ultra-low latency. StarTree manages the underlying infrastructure for you, provides insights from a diverse set of data, and helps you make informed business decisions.

StarTree Cloud also includes tools for a better developer experience, including [StarTree Data Manager](../../concepts/what-is-startree/about-startree-data-manager.md) (for data ingestion) and [StarTree ThirdEye](../../concepts/what-is-startree/about-startree-thirdeye.md) (for anomaly detection), and additional key features to enhance Pinot.

  - [SQL Connector](../../ingest-data/sql-connector.md)
  - [Flexible batch file ingestion](../../ingest-data/file-ingestion-task.md)
  - [Segment import - Parallel real-time to offline segment conversion](../../ingest-data/segment-import-task.md)

  - [Spark-Pinot connector](https://github.com/apache/pinot/blob/master/pinot-connectors/pinot-spark-3-connector/README.md)

 ### Managed Apache Pinot
 
 - **Query latency and speed:** Computes on the fly and is very fast due to the indexing strategies, partitioning/data layout, and bloom filters.  StarTree Cloud supports partial pre-aggregated values to provide very low latency, real-time analytics on the data.
   - Millisecond level latencies for most OLAP queries.
   - Ability to achieve a hard upper bound for query latencies for a given use case
   - Low latency with high throughput.
 - **Data Mutability:** Designed for low cost to answer OLAP queries and low latency on immutable data and mutable data (upsert support).
 - **Indexing:** The following indexing techniques are supported:
   - Inverted index
   - Sorted index
   - Range index
   - JSON index
   - Text index
   - Geospatial index
   - Star-tree index
 - **Throughput:** Purpose-built for supporting very high throughput for the analytical workload. Can support 10000+ QPS in a single cluster.
 - **Cost to serve:** Low columnar storage provides excellent compression leading to lower storage and in-memory footprint.
 - **Operational/Production Readiness:** Built to be multi-tenant. Provides an easy way to scale a cluster up or down, replace nodes, and reshuffle data.
 - **Advanced query features (joins):** Limited support-dim join supported and an early version of fact-fact distributed shuffle join is also available.
 - **Integration with existing data eco-systems:** Integrates well with the rest of the data ecosystem with support for backfills.
 - **Monitoring with alerts sent to StarTree SRE team:** StarTree provides service-level agreement (SLA) guarantees. To meet SLA guarantees, StarTree-managed Pinot environments have a [comprehensive set of metrics being monitored](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/configuration-reference/monitoring-metrics). 
     Additionally, the StarTree site reliability engineering team monitors and resolves Prometheus alerts, and provides notification of these updates as applicable.

 ### StarTree Data Manager
 
 The StarTree Data Manager is a UI that makes it easy to onboard data into a StarTree Cloud.
 
To open Data Manager, go to StarTree Cloud, and click **Data Manager.**
