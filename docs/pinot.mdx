# Apache Pinot

[Apache Pinot](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/) is a real-time distributed OLAP datastore, purpose-built to provide ultra low-latency analytics at extremely high throughput.


It can ingest directly from streaming data sources – such as Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis – and make the events available for querying instantly. 
It can also ingest from batch data sources such as Hadoop HDFS, Amazon S3, Azure ADLS, and Google Cloud Storage.

The guides in this section will help you get up and running.
