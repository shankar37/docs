# Create your first alert

<Callout type="info">
    You must [install ThirdEye](install-thirdeye.md) before you begin.
</Callout>

Alerts are the rules you build to detect anomalies. An alert configuration contains all the information necessary to:
- Fetch data from a datasource
- Preprocess data
- Compute baselines
- Detect anomalies
- Filter anomalies with business rules
- Send alerts to your subscription groups

In this guide, we'll create an alert that detects when a metric lies outside of a defined range. We will use StarTree Cloud, which includes Apache Pinot hosted as software-as-a-service (SaaS).


## Load a sample dataset

To begin, load data into Apache Pinot.

<details>
<summary>Use StarTree Data Manager to load data</summary>

1. Go to your StarTree Data Manager at `data.your.instance.startree.cloud`.
2. Click **Create a Dataset**.
3. In Sample Datasets, click **Complex Website**.
4. Set the name to `complexWebsite`, and then click **Confirm**.

The test dataset is now loaded into Pinot.
</details>

## Set up the datasource

Configure ThirdEye to get access to the Pinot database. 

<details>
<summary>Connect ThirdEye to Pinot</summary>

In StarTree Cloud, ThirdEye connects to the Pinot database automatically. The first time ThirdEye is opened, a page will guide you through the onboarding of the dataset. Ask StarTree support for help if you cannot see Pinot datasets or fail to onboard.
</details>

## Create the alert configuration

1. In StarTree Cloud, open the Thirdeye app.
2. Click **Create Alert**.
3. Copy and paste this JSON in the configuration field:

<details>
<summary>Use this JSON to configure your alert</summary>

```json
{
  "name": "my-first-detection-configuration",
  "description": "",
  "cron": "0 0 5 ? * * *",
  "template": {
    "name": "startree-threshold"
  },
  "templateProperties": {
    "dataSource": "pinot",
    "dataset": "complexWebsite",
    "aggregationFunction": "sum",
    "aggregationColumn": "views",
    "max": "15000",
    "min": "5000",
    "monitoringGranularity": "P1D"
  }
}
```
*quickstart_complexWebsite_alert.json*
</details>

   This configuration uses the `startree-threshold` template. A template contains all the logic to perform a detection, and exposes configuration fields. Properties are configured in `templateProperties`.

   With this configuration, the following logic is applied: 
      - An SQL query returns the sum of views, grouped by day, from the `complexWebSite` table.
      - A threshold rule is applied to the query results. If a data point falls outside the thresholds, it is flagged as an anomaly.

      For more information about alert configuration, see [understanding detection configuration](../alert-configuration.md).
   </Callout>

4. Below the JSON configuration, in the preview panel, press the refresh button: you will see the result of the detection configuration. Notice that there are a few anomalies.
   <img src="/img/thirdeye/_cloud_quickstart_alert_preview.png" width="80%" /><br />
   Try changing the dates on the timeframe selector in the top right corner and the min/max values in the JSON to see what happens. Click the legend fields at the bottom to show/hide timeseries.

5. (Optional) Use the notifications panel below the chart to send anomaly messages to external systems like Slack and email. To create a notification, click **Create Alert**.

ThirdEye will guide you through the process, helping you find the right algorithm for your data. Once you get to the end and click **Create**, your first alert is created, and you will be redirected to the alert page.

When an alert is created, the detection is rerun on past data. It may take a few seconds, 
so you may have to refresh the page.


## View an anomaly

1. Click an anomaly to open the anomaly page.
   <br></br><img src="/img/thirdeye/_cloud_quickstart_alert_page.png" width="80%" />

2. Click investigate to open the root-cause analysis page.
   <br></br><img src="/img/thirdeye/_cloud_quickstart_anomaly_page.png" width="80%" />

3. Use the bottom tabs to explore and help you find the root-cause of the anomaly.
