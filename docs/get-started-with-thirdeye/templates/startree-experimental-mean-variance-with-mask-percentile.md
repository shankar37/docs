# startree-experimental-mean-variance-with-mask-percentile 
## Description 
Experimental. Detect an anomaly if the metric is not in `mean Â± n*std`. `mean` and `std` (standard deviation) are estimated with historical data.  The amount of historical data to use is set with the `lookback` property. Aggregation function with 2 operands: PERCENTILETDIGEST, DISTINCTCOUNTHLL,etc...

|eventMaskerLookaround|Used to mask periods based on events. Offset to apply on startTime and endTime to look around the timeframe when fetching events. In ISO-8601 format. Example: `P1D`.|P2D|
|eventMaskerTypes|Used to mask periods based on events. List of event types to fetch by. Example: `["HOLIDAY", "DEPLOYMENT"]`. `[]` fetches all events. Use `["__NO_EVENTS"]` to disable.|['__NO_EVENTS']|
|eventMaskerBeforeEventMargin|Used to mask periods based on events. A period in ISO-8601 format that corresponds to a period that should be included in the event. Example: if beforeEventMargin is `P1D` and the event happens on `[Dec 24 0:00, Dec 25 0:00[`, then the event will be considered to happen on `[Dec 23 0:00 and Dec 25 0:00[`|P0D|
|eventMaskerAfterEventMargin|Used to mask periods based on events. Same as eventMaskerBeforeEventMargin at the end of the event.|P0D|

### DETECTION
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|lookback|Historical time period to use to train the model. In ISO-8601 format. Example: `P21D`.|-|

|lowerBoundMultiplier|Factor applied to the lower bound, such that `finalLowerBound = lowerBound * lowerBoundMultiplier`. Can help to stabilize bounds. If not set, no factor is applied.|-|
|pattern|Whether to detect an anomaly if it's a drop, a spike or any of the two.|UP_OR_DOWN|
|seasonalityPeriod|Seasonality to consider when computing mean and variance. Possible values are `P7D` (weekly and smaller periods), `P1D` (daily and smaller periods), PT0S (no seasonality). Eg: with P7D, a Monday 12 AM value will be estimated from the mean and variance of the previous Monday 12 AM values. |PT0S|
|metricMinimumValue|If set, the predicted value of the detector and the lower/upper bounds cannot be smaller than the given value. For instance, set it to 0 if your metric cannot have a negative value.|-|
|metricMaximumValue|If set, the predicted value of the detector and the lower/upper bounds cannot be bigger than the given value. For instance, set it to 100 if your metric cannot be bigger than 100.|-|

### FILTER
#### Time of week
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|daysOfWeek|Used to ignore anomalies that happen at specific time periods. A list of days. Anomalies happening on these days are ignored if timeOfWeekIgnore is true. Example: `["MONDAY", "SUNDAY"]`.|[]|
|hoursOfDay|Used to ignore anomalies that happen at specific time periods. A list of hours. Anomalies happening on these hours are ignored. Example: `[0,1,2,23]`|[]|
|dayHoursOfWeek|Used to ignore anomalies that happen at specific time periods. A mapping of `{DAY: [hours]}`. Anomalies happening on these timeframes are ignored if timeOfWeekIgnore is true. Example: `{"FRIDAY": [22, 23], "SATURDAY": [0, 1, 2]}`|{}|
#### Sql Filter
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|sqlFilterStatement|Sql statement to ignore anomalies based on values returned by the detector. If the statement evaluates to true, the anomaly is ignored. Available columns: `observed` (the current value), `predicted` (the value predicted by the detector), `upper_bound` (the upper bound value predicted by the detector), `lower_bound` and `ts` (the timestamp of the point). For instance: `(lower_bound < 10) or (lower_bound = upper_bound and upper_bound = 0)`. The default statement `false` means no anomaly is filtered.|false|
#### Threshold
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|thresholdFilterMin|Used to ignore anomalies that don't meet the thresholdFilter min and max. Example: set `thresholdFilterMin = 10` to ignore anomalies when the metric is smaller than 10. Can help ignore anomalies happening in low data regimes. Filter threshold minimum. If `-1`, no minimum threshold is applied.|-1|
|thresholdFilterMax|Used to ignore anomalies that don't meet the thresholdFilter min and max. Example: set `thresholdFilterMin = 10` to ignore anomalies when the metric is smaller than 10. Can help ignore anomalies happening in low data regimes. Filter threshold maximum. If `-1`, no maximum threshold is applied.|-1|
|thresholdFilterMetrics|A list of metrics to apply the threshold filter on. For instance, if set to `["current", "upperBound"]`, the filter will apply when both current and upperBound values are outside the filter range.|-|
#### Guardrail metric

|guardrailMetricMin|Used to ignore anomalies that don't meet the guardrail threshold. Minimum threshold of the guardrail metric. If `-1`, no minimum threshold is applied.|-1|

|guardrailMetric|Used to ignore anomalies that don't meet the guardrail threshold. Metric to use as a threshold guardrail. Example: `COUNT(*)` and set `guardrailMetricMin = 100` to ignore anomalies detected when there is less than 100 observations in the period.|COUNT(*)|

### POSTPROCESS
#### Data mutability
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|mutabilityPeriod|Use if your data is mutable. ThirdEye will maintain the detection results up to date on the mutable period. For instance, if your last 10 days of data is mutable, set `P10D`. At each cron detection job, the detection results for the last 10 days will be updated.|P0D|
|reNotifyPercentageThreshold|For detection replay when data is mutable. If the percentage difference between an existing anomaly and a new anomaly on the same time frame is above this threshold, renotify. Combined with `reNotifyAbsoluteThreshold`. Both thresholds must pass to be re-notified. If zero, always renotify. If null or negative, never re-notifies.|-1|
|reNotifyAbsoluteThreshold|For detection replay when data is mutable. If the absolute difference between an existing anomaly and a new anomaly on the same time frame is above this threshold, renotify. Combined with `reNotifyPercentageThreshold`. Both thresholds must pass to be re-notified. If zero, always renotify. If null or negative, never re-notifies.|-1|
#### Anomaly merger

| --- | --- | --- |
|mergeMaxGap|Maximum duration of an anomaly merger. At merge time, if an anomaly merger would get bigger than this limit, the anomalies are not merged. In ISO-8601 format. Example: `P7D`.||
|mergeMaxDuration|Maximum gap between 2 anomalies for anomalies to be merged. In ISO-8601 format. Example: `PT2H`. To disable anomalies merging, set this value to `P0D`.||

|rcaAggregationFunction|The aggregation function to use for RCA. If the detection metric name is known to ThirdEye, this parameter is optional.||

|rcaEventSqlFilter|A Sql filter for RCA events. Only events that match the filter will be shown in the RCA related events tab. [Learn more](https://dev.startree.ai/docs/startree-enterprise-edition/startree-thirdeye/concepts/alert-configuration#sqlfilter).||
