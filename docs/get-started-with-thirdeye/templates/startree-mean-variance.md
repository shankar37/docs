# startree-mean-variance 
## Description 
Detect an anomaly if the metric is not in `mean Â± n*std`. `mean` and `std` (standard deviation) are estimated with historical data.  The amount of historical data to use is set with the `lookback` property. Aggregation function with 1 operand: SUM, MAX,etc...

|timeColumn|TimeColumn used to group by time. If set to AUTO (the default value), the Pinot primary time column is used.|AUTO|
|timeColumnFormat|Required if timeColumn is not AUTO. [Learn more](https://dev.startree.ai/docs/startree-enterprise-edition/startree-thirdeye/reference/operators/data-fetcher#timeformat-strings).||

### DETECTION
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|lookback|Historical time period to use to train the model. In ISO-8601 format. Example: `P21D`.|-|
|sensitivity|The sensitivity of the model. The smaller, the less anomaly are detected.|-|
|pattern|Whether to detect an anomaly if it's a drop, a spike or any of the two.|UP_OR_DOWN|
|seasonalityPeriod|Seasonality to consider when computing mean and variance. Possible values are `P7D` (weekly and smaller periods), `P1D` (daily and smaller periods), PT0S (no seasonality). Eg: with P7D, a Monday 12 AM value will be estimated from the mean and variance of the previous Monday 12 AM values. |PT0S|

### FILTER
#### Time of week
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|daysOfWeek|Used to ignore anomalies that happen at specific time periods. A list of days. Anomalies happening on these days are ignored if timeOfWeekIgnore is true. Example: `["MONDAY", "SUNDAY"]`.|[]|
|hoursOfDay|Used to ignore anomalies that happen at specific time periods. A list of hours. Anomalies happening on these hours are ignored. Example: `[0,1,2,23]`|[]|
|dayHoursOfWeek|Used to ignore anomalies that happen at specific time periods. A mapping of `{DAY: [hours]}`. Anomalies happening on these timeframes are ignored if timeOfWeekIgnore is true. Example: `{"FRIDAY": [22, 23], "SATURDAY": [0, 1, 2]}`|{}|
#### Threshold
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|thresholdFilterMin|Used to ignore anomalies that don't meet the thresholdFilter min and max. Example: set `thresholdFilterMin = 10` to ignore anomalies when the metric is smaller than 10. Can help ignore anomalies happening in low data regimes. Filter threshold minimum. If `-1`, no minimum threshold is applied.|-1|
|thresholdFilterMax|Used to ignore anomalies that don't meet the thresholdFilter min and max. Example: set `thresholdFilterMin = 10` to ignore anomalies when the metric is smaller than 10. Can help ignore anomalies happening in low data regimes. Filter threshold maximum. If `-1`, no maximum threshold is applied.|-1|
#### Guardrail metric
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|guardrailMetricMin|Used to ignore anomalies that don't meet the guardrail threshold. Minimum threshold of the guardrail metric. If `-1`, no minimum threshold is applied.|-1|
|guardrailMetricMax|Used to ignore anomalies that don't meet the guardrail threshold. Maximum threshold of guardrailMetric. If `-1`, no maximum threshold is applied.|-1|
|guardrailMetric|Used to ignore anomalies that don't meet the guardrail threshold. Metric to use as a threshold guardrail. Example: `COUNT(*)` and set `guardrailMetricMin = 100` to ignore anomalies detected when there is less than 100 observations in the period.|COUNT(*)|
#### Special events
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|eventFilterSqlFilter|Used to ignore anomalies that happen during events. Sql filter to apply on the events. [Learn more](https://dev.startree.ai/docs/startree-enterprise-edition/startree-thirdeye/reference/operators/event-fetcher#sql-filter)||
|eventFilterLookaround|Used to ignore anomalies that happen during events. Offset to apply on startTime and endTime to look around the timeframe. In ISO-8601 format. Example: `P1D`.|P2D|
|eventFilterTypes|Used to ignore anomalies that happen during events. List of event types to fetch by. Example: `["HOLIDAY", "DEPLOYMENT"]`. `[]` fetches all events. Use `["__NO_EVENTS"]` to disable.|['__NO_EVENTS']|
|eventFilterBeforeEventMargin|Used to ignore anomalies that happen during events. A period in ISO-8601 format that corresponds to a period that is also impacted by the event. Example: if beforeEventMargin is `P1D`, if event happens on `[Dec 24 0:00, Dec 25 0:00[`, the label will be applied to anomalies happening on `[Dec 23 0:00 and Dec 25 0:00[`|P0D|
|eventFilterAfterEventMargin|Used to ignore anomalies that happen during events. Same as eventFilterBeforeEventMargin at the end of the event.|P0D|

### POSTPROCESS
#### Data mutability
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|mutabilityPeriod|Use if your data is mutable. ThirdEye will maintain the detection results up to date on the mutable period. For instance, if your last 10 days of data is mutable, set `P10D`. At each cron detection job, the detection results for the last 10 days will be updated.|P0D|
|reNotifyPercentageThreshold|For detection replay when data is mutable. If the percentage difference between an existing anomaly and a new anomaly on the same time frame is above this threshold, renotify. Combined with `reNotifyAbsoluteThreshold`. Both thresholds must pass to be re-notified. If zero, always renotify. If null or negative, never re-notifies.|-1|
|reNotifyAbsoluteThreshold|For detection replay when data is mutable. If the absolute difference between an existing anomaly and a new anomaly on the same time frame is above this threshold, renotify. Combined with `reNotifyPercentageThreshold`. Both thresholds must pass to be re-notified. If zero, always renotify. If null or negative, never re-notifies.|-1|
#### Anomaly merger
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|mergeMaxGap|Maximum gap between 2 anomalies for anomalies to be merged. In ISO-8601 format. Example: `PT2H`. The default behavior is to merge consecutive anomalies only. To disable anomaly merging entirely, set this value to `P0D`.||
|mergeMaxDuration|Maximum duration of an anomaly merger. At merge time, if an anomaly merger would get bigger than this limit, the anomalies are not merged. In ISO-8601 format. Example: `P7D`.||

### RCA
| name | description | default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
|rcaAggregationFunction|The aggregation function to use for RCA. If the detection metric name is known to ThirdEye, this parameter is optional.||
|rcaIncludedDimensions|List of the dimensions (columns in the dataset) to use in RCA drill-downs. If not set or empty, all dimensions of the table are used. [Learn more](https://dev.startree.ai/docs/startree-enterprise-edition/startree-thirdeye/concepts/alert-configuration#dimensions).|[]|
|rcaExcludedDimensions|List of dimensions (columns in the dataset) to ignore in RCA drill-downs. If not set or empty, all dimensions of the table are used. rcaExcludedDimensions and rcaIncludedDimensions cannot be used at the same time.|[]|
|rcaEventTypes|A list of type to filter on for RCA. Only events that match such types will be shown in the RCA related events tab. [Learn more](https://dev.startree.ai/docs/startree-enterprise-edition/startree-thirdeye/concepts/alert-configuration#types).|[]|
|rcaEventSqlFilter|A Sql filter for RCA events. Only events that match the filter will be shown in the RCA related events tab. [Learn more](https://dev.startree.ai/docs/startree-enterprise-edition/startree-thirdeye/concepts/alert-configuration#sqlfilter).||
