Let's review the boxes one by one. 

### UI 
This is the service that ... serves the web interface. It communicates with the backend.

### Coordinator
The **Coordinator** is the entry point of the REST API. 
The request are (optionally) authenticated and authorized.  
The coordinator can perform CRUD operations on ThirdEye [entities](./), 
simulate detection pipeline, and run interactive RCA.

### Scheduler
The **Scheduler** runs the task crons and create the task objects. The tasks are persisted in the database and polled by the workers. 
The 2 main type of tasks are detection tasks and notification tasks.

### Worker
**Workers** run the tasks. Here is the execution principle: 
- workers wait for tasks to be added to the queue
- once a worker finds a new task, it assigns it to itself (gets a lock)
- on successfully getting a lock, the worker executes the task
- upon completion, the worker captures the results and persists them into the db

## Notes
UI, coordinator, and worker can be scaled independently based on their respective load.  
The scheduler is not replicated.
