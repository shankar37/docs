# Aggregation functions

Unlike the detection pipeline, root cause analysis (RCA) algorithms have a limited set of aggregation functions available.

If the [metric used for RCA](alert-configuration.md#metric) is onboarded in ThirdEye, a default aggregation function is available. If the metric is a derived metric or is not onboarded in ThirdEye, the aggregation function should be set in the alert configuration [aggregationFunction](alert-configuration.md#aggregationfunction) field.

## Available aggregation functions

| name  | description  | 
|---|---|
|  `SUM` | Sum of the metric |
|  `AVG` | Average of the metric |
|  `COUNT` | Count of the lines  |
|  `COUNT_DISTINCT` | Distinct count of the lines  |
|  `MAX` | Maximum of the metric   |
|  `MIN` | Minimum of the metric   |
|  `PCT50` | 50th percentile of the metric   |
|  `PCT90` | 90th percentile of the metric   |
|  `PCT95` | 95th percentile of the metric   |
|  `PCT99` | 99th percentile of the metric   |

## Datasource compatibility
Some datasources may not be compatible with all aggregation functions.
