# Dimension Drift Operators

The ThirdEye drift operators are used to measure population drift across each value of a dimension.

Thirdeye has two drift operators: 
1. [Static Drift Operator](dimension-drift/static-drift-operator.md)
2. [Lookback Drift Operator](dimension-drift/lookback-drift-operator.md)

The output of the dimension drift operators can be passed into any anomaly detector.

### How does this work?

#### What it does?
- Detects Changes in Data: This operator is like a microscope for your data. It looks for shifts or unusual patterns in specific parts of your data (dimensions). For example, imagine you're tracking website traffic by country â€“ this operator could alert you if there's a sudden spike in visitors from a new location.
- Compares to the Past: The "lookback" part means it compares your current data to a historical snapshot. This helps it figure out what's normal and what's an unexpected change.
- Gives You a "Drift Score": The operator calculates how different your current data is from the past. A higher score means a potentially significant change.

#### How it Works (simplified)?
- Choose Your Focus: You tell the operator which dimension to watch (e.g., country of website visitors, product category, customer age group).
- Lookback Window: You set how far back in time it should compare (e.g., last week, last month).
- Calculates Differences: It compares the distribution of values in your current data against the historical data. Is the mix of countries, product types, or ages roughly the same?
- Assigns "Drift Score": Based on the calculated difference, it gives you a score to indicate the level of change or "drift".

#### Why This Matters?
- Spotting problems early: If a critical part of your data suddenly changes, it could signal a problem (website outage in a certain country, a product becoming unexpectedly popular) or a new opportunity.
- Keeping track of trends: It helps you understand if your data is gradually shifting over time, even if the changes aren't dramatic at any one moment.
