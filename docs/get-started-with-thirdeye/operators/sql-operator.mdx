# SqlExecution

Applies arbitrary SQL on any data. SQL is applied in memory.


## Inputs

Any number of inputs. `targetProperty` is used as the table name when SQL is executed. 


## Outputs

One output for each query. `outputKey` names are `0`, `1`, `2` etc... corresponding to the number of the query.


## Parameters

| name  | description  | default value  |
|---|---|---|
|  `sql.engine` | SQL Engine to use. <br/>Either `CALCITE` or `HYPERSQL`. | `HYPERSQL` |
|  `sql.queries` | A list of sql queries to execute. |   |
|  `jdbc.parameters` | Additional jdbc parameters to pass. In a key-value format.  |   |


### Available SQL Engines for `engine`


#### HYPERSQL
HSQLDB SQL. [See SQL reference](http://hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/sqlgeneral-chapt.html).  
Input data is copied to an in-memory HSQLDB, then SQL is applied.


#### CALCITE
Apache Calcite SQL. Very close to ANSI SQL. [See SQL reference](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/reference.html).  
Try Calcite SQL [online here](https://calcite-online.system.gavinray.dev).  
BigQuery functions [listed here](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/reference.html#dialect-specific-operators) are available.
In particular, `TIMESTAMP_MILLIS` and `UNIX_MILLIS`  are available to easily convert epoch to time and vice-versa.  
The implementation is zero-copy, meaning no data is copied from the ThirdEye app to another process. SQL is run on the Java data directly.
