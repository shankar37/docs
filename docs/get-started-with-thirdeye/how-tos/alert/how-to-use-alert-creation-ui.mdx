# How to use the alert creation UI

The alert creation UI is where you will create new alerts and there are 2 modes: `Simple` and `Advanced`.
- The `Simple` mode will prompt you for the different parts of the alert configuration and build the [configuration](../../alert-configuration.md) JSON.
- You can see the current status of the JSON in `Advanced` mode or switch to that mode to paste your own configuration.

1. Browse to the **Configuration** page.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Click the **Create Alert** menu item.

This will take you to the alert creation UI, defaulting to `Advanced` mode.


## Simple Mode

You can switch to simple mode in the top right section of the page where there is a switch for the 2 modes.


### The Sections

</p>


#### 1 - Alert Details

In this section, you will be prompted to input the `name` of the alert. Ensure this is unique and no other existing alert has the same name.

The `description` is optional.

The `cron` section is where you can schedule where you can configure how often the pipelines checks for anomalies. The cron is expected to be in [quartz](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html) format.


#### 2 - Template Property Input

This section allows you to select an [Alert Template](./use-templates.md) to use for your configuration. Alert templates are entities in ThirdEye that help make creating new alerts with less copying and pasting. Several come out of the box with a new installation of ThirdEye. Alert templates require you to enter properties specific to your environment which you will be prompted for in the section below `Template type`.


#### 3 - Preview Configuration

This section allows you to preview the alert configuration by seeing the metric trend and the anomalies that may be detected. You will see a button to preview once all the template properties are input.

The preview button looks like the one below:

When data is loaded, it will look like the screenshot below
