# How to use the ThirdEye API

ThirdEye exposes a CRUD API. This make it easy to use ThirdEye as a headless service from your apps. The easiest way to discover and try the different endpoints is to use Swagger.

## Using Swagger

Swagger is exposed by the coordinator at `[coordinator_url]/swagger`. If you use StarTree ThirdEye or the Helm charts, Swagger is also exposed by the frontend app at `[your_thirdeye_url]/swagger`.

1. Go to `[your_thirdeye_url]/swagger`
2. If your instance uses authentication, click the "Authorize" button and provide a [bearer token](#obtaining-a-bearer-token).
3. If your instance use HTTPS, switch HTTP to HTTPS.

4. Try the endpoints.


### Obtaining a bearer token

If your instance uses authentication, the frontend passes a bearer token when performing requests. In your browser, in the devtools, you can see the bearer token.

You can copy and paste the token into the Swagger UI.

### Obtaining a long-lasting token (basic auth token)

**StarTree cloud users**: To obtain a basic auth token for StarTree ThirdEye, contact [StarTree Tech Support](https://support.startree.ai/support/home), and then complete **step 3** below (skipping steps 1-2). 

#### Step 1 - Update ThirdEye configuration in the Helm chart

```bash
auth:
  enabled: true
  basic:
    enabled: true
    users:
      - username: <USERNAME>
        password: <PASSWORD>
 ```

#### Step 2 - Use the generated basic auth token in requests

To authenticate a request, add the `Authorization` header with the token value as the base64 encoded value of `username:password` prefixed with `Basic`. 

**Example:**   
`Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzcw==` where `YWRtaW46cGFzcw==` is the base64 encoded value of `admin:pass`.

To encode on macOs: 
```bash
echo -D '<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>' | base64
```

#### Step 3 - Use the Basic Auth token in Swagger

Copy and paste the token `YWRtaW46cGFzcw==` in the [Swagger UI](#using-swagger) as `Basic YWRtaW46cGFzcw==`.
