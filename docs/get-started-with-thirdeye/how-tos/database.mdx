# Connect a Data Source

A `datasource` is an entity, such as an Apache Pinot instance. Data sources must be registered in ThirdEye to enable ThirdEye to use them. A datasource can have many `datasets` which are like tables. Those datasets can have many `metrics`.

Currently ThirdEye supports connecting with Apache Pinot. To connect to other data sources, [reach out to StarTree](https://www.startree.ai/#talk).

To connect with StarTree Extensions, Pinot SQL and Pinot, use the following links:
- [Managed Pinot](database/startree-pinot.md)
- [Pinot SQL](database/pinot-sql.md)
- [Pinot](database/pinot.md)
