# Google Cloud Pubsub Ingestion

## Prerequisites

The following settings need to be configured so that messages can be consumed correctly from a Pubsub topic. 

### Pubsub Topic Settings

The pubsub topic containing the data to be consumed should have the following configurations:

1. Topic retention must be enabled. Otherwise, data prior to the creation of the subscriber will be lost.
2. Topic's [message storage policy](https://googleapis.dev/java/google-cloud-pubsub/latest/com/google/pubsub/v1/MessageStoragePolicy.html) must configured to use a single region. 
This is required for ordering guarantees in pubsub.

### Pubsub Publisher Settings

The published data should contain certain attributes to work correctly with Pinot.
1. If data is expected to be partitioned (See `attributeFilterKey` for more info), then a user-attribute representing the partition ID should be added to each [Pubsub message](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rest/v1/PubsubMessage). 
This attribute key should be specified in the [streams configuration](#Configurations).
2. Set `orderingKey` in the Pubsub message to be the same as the `partitionId` value used above. 

## Pinot Table Configuration

Apart from the common [real-time table configuration](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/configuration-reference/table#realtime-table-config), there are some extra config values that you need to setup.

### Segment Configs

Segment completion under `segmentsConfig` should be set to `DOWNLOAD` in order to avoid errors during the segment completion protocol.

```json
{
  "tableName": "<tableName>",
  ...,
  "segmentsConfig": {
    "completionConfig": {
      "completionMode": "DOWNLOAD"
    }, 
    ...
  }
}
```

### Stream Configs

The following streams configs are available for configuration:

If this threshold is crossed, Pinot will close the current consumer and instantiate a new one. A higher value is recommended to avoid excessive admin operations that occurs during pubsub consumer creation. This behavior can be disable by using value `-1` . Default is 3 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The data published to the topic should always contain this attribute in its attributes map and its valid values are [`0`, `numPartitions`). <br/>Failing to satisfy the above condition may cause data loss. |

### Environment variables

The `PubsubConsumerFactory` requires setting up an environmental variable called `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` which contains the path to the GCP credentials file. 
Alternatively, the path to the GCP credentials file can be set using the config property `credentialsFile`. 
The former approach is strongly recommended. 

## Google Pubsub emulator

Google cloud SDK provides an emulator that can be used for local testing. 
To install the emulator, see the [Testing apps locally with the emulator](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator#prereq) documentation.

All configuration is the same as above, except the following:

| Config Property | Value                                                                  | 
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| stream.pubsub.consumer.factory.class.name | `ai.startree.pinot.plugin.stream.pubsub.EmulatorPubsubConsumerFactory` |


The environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is not required. 
Instead, the environmental variable `PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST` should be set to the emulator endpoint in the form `<hostname>:<port>`.

## Config Tuning Recommendations

### subscription.ackDeadlineSeconds
This config is used for the pubsub subscription and specifies the deadline after which unacknowledged message is
sent again to the pubsub client. It is recommended to use the max allowed value as Pinot consumer acknowledges messages
in batches. Default value is 600 seconds (allowed max in pubsub client). Ideally, there should be no need to tune this
config.

### subscription.maxOutstandingCount
This config is used for flow control as the consumer implementation uses an asynchronous pull-based subscription. If
there are more unack'd messages in the subscriber's buffer, there is an increased chance of re-delivery in pubsub.
Hence, if you notice a lot of log warnings about duplicate message received, you can tune down this number.

### maxConsumedMessages
This config is used to control the number of messages processed (ie. record extracted and indexed into an in-memory
pinot segment) in a batch. Message flow in pubsub is adaptive and varies over time. Hence, this value can be
tuned in cases where indexing time is large and causes message re-delivery from pubsub.

### queueOperationTimeout
This timeout is used by shared internal pubsub queues. The default value should be sufficient for most cases as there 
isn't expected to be a lot of contention. If the `maxConsumedMessages` is configured correctly, then the queue will 
have sufficient capacity for buffering.
