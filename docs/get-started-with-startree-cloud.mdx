# Get started with StarTree Cloud

There are two ways to get started using StarTree Cloud. The easiest is the Free 30-day software-as-a-service (SaaS) trial. If you know what you need and are planning to use your own infrastructure, contact sales to begin the process of using bring-your-own-cloud (BYOC).
