Upsert is a term used to describe inserting a record into a database if it does not already exist or update it if it does exist. 

Practically, events arriving in a stream can have updated attributes at a later point in time. For example, an e-commerce order can transition between multiple states of a state machine, including `CREATED`, `PROCESSING`, `IN_TRANSIT`, and `DELIVERED`. A [change data capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) (CDC) stream capturing an orders table may emit change events containing different values for the order status.

But, from an analytics perspective, you may only interested in the most up-to-date version and state for each order. For example, consider writing a SQL query to retrieve orders that took more than two days for the delivery. To enable that, we need to merge all change events belonging to a particular order to its latest value.

Apache Pinot supports that by enabling upserts on a real-time table.

## Understanding upserts in Pinot

Pinot, by default, allows querying all events ingested from a Kafka topic by a particular primary key (a dimension). Revisiting our e-commerce example above, that kind of a query will return all the state changes for all orders. In some cases, we need to get back the most up-to-date version and state for each order.

Pinot is an immutable datastore, which means that there is no genuine concept of upsert as you stream data into it from Kafka. For the upsert implementation, itâ€™s essential to understand that an individual record is not updated via a write; instead, updates are appended to a log and a pointer maintains the most recent version of a record.

Pinot upserts work in two modes:
1. Full upserts 
2. [Partial upserts](upserts-partial.md)

We will focus on full upserts in this recipe.

To learn how to use full upserts on a real-time Pinot table, watch the following video, or complete the tutorial below, starting with [Prerequites](/docs/pinot/recipes/upserts-full#prerequisites).

## Prerequisites

To follow the code examples in this guide, you must [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) locally and [download recipes](/docs/pinot/recipes/#download-recipes).

## Navigate to recipe

1. If you haven't already, [download recipes](/docs/pinot/recipes/#download-recipes).
2. In terminal, go to the recipe by running the following command:
  ```bash
  cd pinot-recipes/recipes/upserts-full
  ```

## Start Pinot and learn

Spin up a Pinot cluster using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose \
		-f ../pinot-compose.yml \
		-f ../kafka-compose.yml up -d
```

Add table and schema:

```bash
docker cp config/orders_schema.json pinot-controller:/opt/pinot/
docker cp config/orders_table.json pinot-controller:/opt/pinot/

docker exec pinot-controller ./bin/pinot-admin.sh AddTable \
     -schemaFile /opt/pinot/orders_schema.json \
     -tableConfigFile /opt/pinot/orders_table.json \
    -exec

```

Open a tab to import messages into Kafka:

```bash
docker exec -it kafka kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic orders
```

Paste the following:

```json
{"order_id":1,"customer_id":104,"order_status":"IN_TRANSIT","amount":29.35,"ts":"1632467063"}
{"order_id":2,"customer_id":105,"order_status":"COMPLETED","amount":3.24,"ts":"1618931459"}
{"order_id":3,"customer_id":103,"order_status":"OPEN","amount":9.77,"ts":"1626484196"}
{"order_id":4,"customer_id":104,"order_status":"COMPLETED","amount":90.35,"ts":"1623066325"}
{"order_id":5,"customer_id":105,"order_status":"OPEN","amount":55.52,"ts":"1635543905"}
```

Query Pinot:

```sql
select * 
from orders 
limit 10
```

Go back to the Kafka tab and paste the following:

```json
{"order_id":5,"customer_id":105,"order_status":"CANCELLED","amount":55.52,"ts":"1635543948"}
```

Run the following query in Pinot to see that the `order_status` is for `order_id` 5 is now set to `CANCELLED`.

```sql
select * 
from orders 
where order_id=5
```
