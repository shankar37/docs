# Extract parts of date

In this recipe we'll learn how to extract parts of a date from a timestamp column.

## Launch Pinot Cluster

You can spin up a Pinot Cluster by running the following command, which starts up the Hybrid QuickStart:

```bash
docker run \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    apachepinot/pinot:1.0.0 QuickStart \
    -type hybrid
```

This command will run a single instance of the Pinot Controller, Pinot Server, Pinot Broker, Kafka, and Zookeeper all in one container.

## The Hybrid Quickstart

The Hybrid Quickstart contains an offline and real-time table called `airlineStats`. 
These tables contain details of various flights from 2014. 

We can view the schema of the table by calling the `/schemas/<schemaName>` command. 

To get a list of the dimension fields, we can filter the results using jq like this:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/schemas/airlineStats" 2>/dev/null | jq -c '.dimensionFieldSpecs[]'
```

Output:

```json
{"name":"ActualElapsedTime","dataType":"INT"}
{"name":"AirTime","dataType":"INT"}
{"name":"AirlineID","dataType":"INT"}
{"name":"ArrDel15","dataType":"INT"}
{"name":"ArrDelay","dataType":"INT"}
...
```

To get a list of date time fields, we can filter the results using jq like this:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/schemas/airlineStats" 2>/dev/null | jq -c '.dateTimeFieldSpecs[]'
```

Output:

```json
{"name":"DaysSinceEpoch","dataType":"INT","format":"1:DAYS:EPOCH","granularity":"1:DAYS"}
{"name":"ts","dataType":"TIMESTAMP","format":"1:MILLISECONDS:TIMESTAMP","granularity":"1:SECONDS"}
{"name":"tsRaw","dataType":"TIMESTAMP","format":"1:MILLISECONDS:TIMESTAMP","granularity":"1:SECONDS"}
```

`ts` and `tsRaw` are the timestamp columns in this table.

## Extracting date components

We can extract various components of the `ts` column using the [`EXTRACT`](https://modern-sql.com/feature/extract) function that was added in Apache Pinot 0.12.
An example of all the available components is shown below:

```sql
select ts, 
       EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ts) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ts) AS month,
       EXTRACT(DAY FROM ts) AS day, 
       EXTRACT(HOUR FROM ts) AS hour,
       EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM ts) AS min,
       EXTRACT(SECOND FROM ts) AS sec
from airlineStats
order by ts DESC
limit 10
```

|ts|year|month|day|hour|min|sec|
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|2014-02-14 00:00:00.0|2014|2|14|0|0|0|
|2014-02-14 00:00:00.0|2014|2|14|0|0|0|
|2014-02-14 00:00:00.0|2014|2|14|0|0|0|
|2014-02-14 00:00:00.0|2014|2|14|0|0|0|
|2014-02-14 00:00:00.0|2014|2|14|0|0|0|
|2014-02-14 00:00:00.0|2014|2|14|0|0|0|
|2014-02-14 00:00:00.0|2014|2|14|0|0|0|
|2014-02-14 00:00:00.0|2014|2|14|0|0|0|
|2014-02-14 00:00:00.0|2014|2|14|0|0|0|
|2014-02-14 00:00:00.0|2014|2|14|0|0|0|

*Query Results*

We can also group by the extracted values, as shown below:

```sql
select EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ts) AS month,
       EXTRACT(DAY FROM ts) AS day, 
	   count(*)
from airlineStats
group by month, day
order by count(*) DESC
limit 10
```

|month|day|count(*)|
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|1|5|422|
|1|3|409|
|1|2|403|
|1|6|354|
|1|24|343|
|1|9|340|
|1|10|338|
|1|30|333|
|1|29|322|
|1|26|319|
