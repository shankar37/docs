# How to unnest arrays in JSON documents

In this recipe we'll learn how to unnest or explode values when ingesting JSON documents into Apache Pinot.
When we unnest an array it means that we'll create one row in Pinot for each item in the array rather than one row for the whole JSON document.

  <table style={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', borderCollapse: 'collapse', width: '100%' }}>
    <tbody>
      <tr>

        <td style={{ border: '1px solid #ccc', padding: '8px' }}>0.10.0</td>
      </tr>

## Prerequisites

To follow the code examples in this guide, you must [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) locally and [download recipes](/docs/pinot/recipes/#download-recipes).

## Navigate to recipe

1. If you haven't already, [download recipes](/docs/pinot/recipes/#download-recipes).
2. In terminal, go to the recipe by running the following command:
  ```bash
  cd pinot-recipes/recipes/json-unnest
  ```

## Launch Pinot Cluster

You can spin up a Pinot Cluster by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will run a single instance of the Pinot Controller, Pinot Server, Pinot Broker, and Zookeeper.
You can find the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/startreedata/pinot-recipes/blob/main/recipes/json-unnest/docker-compose.yml) file on GitHub.

## Dataset

We're going to import the following JSON file:

```
*data/movies.json*

</div>

We're particularly interested in the `Ratings` property of each movie.
We're going to unnest or explode the ratings so that we have one row per rating in our database after the data is ingested.


## Pinot Schema and Table

Now let's create a Pinot Schema and Table.

First, the schema:

```json {12-19}
{
  "schemaName": "movie_ratings",
  "dimensionFieldSpecs": [
    {
      "name": "Title",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    },
    {
      "name": "Year",
      "dataType": "INT"
    },
    {
      "name": "Ratings.Source",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    },
    {
      "name": "Ratings.Value",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    },
    {
      "name": "Rated",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    }
  ]
}
```
*config/schema.json*

When we unnest a JSON list in a document, column names will be prefixed with the parent property name, in this case `Ratings`.

We'll also have the following table config:

```json {9-13}
{
  "tableName": "movie_ratings",
  "tableType": "OFFLINE",
  "segmentsConfig": {
    "replication": 1,
    "schemaName": "movie_ratings"
  },
  "ingestionConfig": {
    "complexTypeConfig": {
      "fieldsToUnnest": [
        "Ratings"
      ]
    },
    "batchIngestionConfig": {
      "segmentIngestionType": "APPEND",
      "segmentIngestionFrequency": "DAILY"
    },    
  },
  "tenants": {
    "broker": "DefaultTenant",
    "server": "DefaultTenant"
  },
  "tableIndexConfig": {
    "loadMode": "MMAP"
  },
  "metadata": {}
}
```
*config/table.json*

The highlighted config specifies which field in the data source should be unnested.
The `Ratings` field contains an array of JSON objects and that array will be exploded to create one row for each item in the array.

<Callout>
If you want to rename the unnested fields, see [How to rename fields when unnesting arrays in JSON documents](json-unnest-rename-fields.md)
</Callout>

You can create the table and schema by running the following command:`

```bash
docker run \
   --network json \
   -v $PWD/config:/config \
   apachepinot/pinot:1.0.0 AddTable \
     -schemaFile /config/schema.json \
     -tableConfigFile /config/table.json \
     -controllerHost "pinot-controller-json" \
    -exec
```

You should see a message similar to the following if everything is working correctly:

```text
2022/05/04 09:11:35.397 INFO [AddTableCommand] [main] Executing command: AddTable -tableConfigFile /config/table.json -schemaFile null -controllerProtocol http -controllerHost 192.168.96.3 -controllerPort 9000 -user null -password [hidden] -exec
2022/05/04 09:11:35.614 INFO [AddTableCommand] [main] {"status":"Table movie_ratings_OFFLINE succesfully added"}
```

## Ingestion Job

Now weâ€™re going to import the JSON file into Pinot. 
We'll do this with the following ingestion spec:

```yaml
executionFrameworkSpec:
  name: 'standalone'
  segmentGenerationJobRunnerClassName: 'org.apache.pinot.plugin.ingestion.batch.standalone.SegmentGenerationJobRunner'
  segmentTarPushJobRunnerClassName: 'org.apache.pinot.plugin.ingestion.batch.standalone.SegmentTarPushJobRunner'
jobType: SegmentCreationAndTarPush
inputDirURI: '/data'
includeFileNamePattern: 'glob:**/movies.json'
outputDirURI: '/opt/pinot/data/movies/'
overwriteOutput: true
pinotFSSpecs:
  - scheme: file
    className: org.apache.pinot.spi.filesystem.LocalPinotFS
recordReaderSpec:
  dataFormat: 'json'
  className: 'org.apache.pinot.plugin.inputformat.json.JSONRecordReader'
tableSpec:
  tableName: 'movie_ratings'
pinotClusterSpecs:
  - controllerURI: 'http://localhost:9000'
pushJobSpec:
  pushAttempts: 2
  pushRetryIntervalMillis: 1000
```
*config/job-spec.yml*

The import job will map fields in each JSON document to a corresponding column in the `movie_ratings` schema.
If one of the fields doesn't exist in the schema it will be skipped.

You can run the following command to run the import:

```bash
docker run \
   --network json \
   -v $PWD/config:/config \
   -v $PWD/data:/data \
   apachepinot/pinot:0.12.0-arm64  LaunchDataIngestionJob \
  -jobSpecFile /config/job-spec.yml
```

## Querying 

Once that's completed, navigate to [localhost:9000/#/query](http://localhost:9000/#/query) and click on the `movie_ratings` table or copy/paste the following query:

```sql
select * 
from movie_ratings 
limit 10
```

You will see the following output:

|Rated|	Ratings.Source|	Ratings.Value|	Title	Year|
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|R	|Internet Movie Database|	8.7/10|	The Matrix|	1999|
|R	|Rotten Tomatoes|	88%	|The Matrix|	1999|
|R	|Metacritic	|73/100	|The Matrix	|1999|
|PG-13|	Internet Movie Database	|7.8/10	|Avatar	|2009|
|PG-13|	Rotten Tomatoes	|82%	|Avatar	|2009|
|PG-13|	Metacritic|	83/100|Avatar	|2009|
|PG|	Internet Movie Database|	6.3/10|	The Boss Baby|2017|
|PG	|Rotten Tomatoes|	53%|The Boss Baby	|2017|
|PG	|Metacritic|	50/100	|The Boss Baby|	2017|
|TV-PG|	Internet Movie Database|	5.2/10|	Tall Girl	|2019|
|TV-PG|	Rotten Tomatoes	|38%|	Tall Girl|	2019|
|TV-MA|	Internet Movie Database	|6.3/10	|Love Hard|	2021|
|TV-MA|	Rotten Tomatoes	|57%|	Love Hard|	2021|
|TV-MA|	Metacritic|	42/100	|Love Hard|	2021|

*Query Results*

We can see that each movie has multiple rows, one for each rating given to that movie.
