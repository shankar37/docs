# How to rename fields when unnesting arrays or flattening objects in JSON documents

In this recipe we'll learn how to rename fields when [unnesting/exploding values](json-unnest.md) or [flattening objects](json-flatten.md) while ingesting JSON documents into Apache Pinot.

## Prerequisites

To follow the code examples in this guide, you must [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) locally and [download recipes](/docs/pinot/recipes/#download-recipes).

## Navigate to recipe

1. If you haven't already, [download recipes](/docs/pinot/recipes/#download-recipes).
2. In terminal, go to the recipe by running the following command:
  ```bash
  cd pinot-recipes/recipes/json-unnest-rename-fields
  ```

## Launch Pinot Cluster

You can spin up a Pinot Cluster by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will run a single instance of the Pinot Controller, Pinot Server, Pinot Broker, and Zookeeper.
You can find the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/startreedata/pinot-recipes/blob/main/recipes/json-unnest-rename-fields/docker-compose.yml) file on GitHub.

## Dataset

We're going to import the following JSON file:

*data/movies.json*

</div>

We're particularly interested in the `Ratings` property of each movie.
We're going to unnest or explode the ratings so that we have one row per rating in our database after the data is ingested.

We'll also pull out the `Meta.Released` property.


## Pinot Schema and Table

Now let's create a Pinot Schema and Table.

First, the schema:

```json 
{
  "schemaName": "movie_ratings",
  "dimensionFieldSpecs": [
    {
      "name": "Title",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    },
    {
      "name": "Released",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    },
    {
      "name": "Rated",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    },
    {
      "name": "Source",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    },
    {
      "name": "Rating",
      "dataType": "STRING"
    }
  ]
}
```
*config/schema.json*

You can create the schema by running the following command:`

```bash
docker exec -it pinot-controller-json bin/pinot-admin.sh AddSchema \
  -schemaFile /config/schema.json \
  -exec
```

We'll also have the following table config:

```json {9-25}
{
  "tableName": "movie_ratings",
  "tableType": "OFFLINE",
  "segmentsConfig": {
    "replication": 1,
    "schemaName": "movie_ratings"
  },
  "ingestionConfig": {
    "complexTypeConfig": {
      "fieldsToUnnest": ["Ratings"]
    },
    "transformConfigs": [
      {
        "columnName": "Released",
        "transformFunction": "Meta.Released"
      },
      {
        "columnName": "Source",
        "transformFunction": "Ratings.Source"
      },
      {
        "columnName": "Rating",
        "transformFunction": "Ratings.Value"
      }
    ],
    "batchIngestionConfig": {
      "segmentIngestionType": "APPEND",
      "segmentIngestionFrequency": "DAILY"
    }
  },
  "tenants": {
    "broker": "DefaultTenant",
    "server": "DefaultTenant"
  },
  "tableIndexConfig": {
    "loadMode": "MMAP"
  },
  "metadata": {}
}
```
*config/table.json*

The existence of the `complexTypeConfig` section means that nested JSON objects will be flattened into individual fields.
It also which field in the data source should be unnested.
The `Ratings` field contains an array of JSON objects and that array will be exploded to create one row for each item in the array.

The `transformConfigs` section maps the following values:

* `Ratings.Source` to the `Source` column
* `Ratings.Value` to the `Rating` column
* `Meta.Released` to the `Released` column.

You can create the table by running the following command:`

```bash
docker run \
   --network json \
   -v $PWD/config:/config \
   apachepinot/pinot:1.0.0 AddTable \
     -schemaFile /config/schema.json \
     -tableConfigFile /config/table.json \
     -controllerHost "pinot-controller-json" \
    -exec
```

## Ingestion Job

Now weâ€™re going to import the JSON file into Pinot. 
We'll do this with the following ingestion spec:

```yaml
executionFrameworkSpec:
  name: 'standalone'
  segmentGenerationJobRunnerClassName: 'org.apache.pinot.plugin.ingestion.batch.standalone.SegmentGenerationJobRunner'
  segmentTarPushJobRunnerClassName: 'org.apache.pinot.plugin.ingestion.batch.standalone.SegmentTarPushJobRunner'
jobType: SegmentCreationAndTarPush
inputDirURI: '/data'
includeFileNamePattern: 'glob:**/movies.json'
outputDirURI: '/opt/pinot/data/movies/'
overwriteOutput: true
pinotFSSpecs:
  - scheme: file
    className: org.apache.pinot.spi.filesystem.LocalPinotFS
recordReaderSpec:
  dataFormat: 'json'
  className: 'org.apache.pinot.plugin.inputformat.json.JSONRecordReader'
tableSpec:
  tableName: 'movie_ratings'
pinotClusterSpecs:
  - controllerURI: 'http://pinot-controller-json:9000'
pushJobSpec:
  pushAttempts: 2
  pushRetryIntervalMillis: 1000
```
*config/job-spec.yml*

The import job will map fields in each JSON document to a corresponding column in the `movie_ratings` schema.
If one of the fields doesn't exist in the schema it will be skipped.

You can run the following command to run the import:

```bash
docker run \
   --network json \
   -v $PWD/config:/config \
   -v $PWD/data:/data \
   apachepinot/pinot:1.0.0 LaunchDataIngestionJob \
  -jobSpecFile /config/job-spec.yml
```

## Querying 

Once that's completed, navigate to [localhost:9000/#/query](http://localhost:9000/#/query) and click on the `movie_ratings` table or copy/paste the following query:

```sql
select * 
from movie_ratings 
limit 10
```

You will see the following output:

|Rated	|Rating	|Released	|Source	|Title|
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|R|	8.7/10|	31 Mar 1999|	Internet Movie Database|	The Matrix|
|R	|88%	|31 Mar 1999	|Rotten Tomatoes	|The Matrix|
|R	|73/100	|31 Mar 1999|	Metacritic	|The Matrix|
|PG-13|	7.8/10	|18 Dec 2009|	Internet Movie Database|	Avatar|
|PG-13|	82%	|18 Dec 2009	|Rotten Tomatoes	|Avatar|
|PG-13|	83/100	|18 Dec 2009|	Metacritic	|Avatar|
|PG	|6.3/10	|31 Mar 2017	|Internet Movie Database|	The Boss Baby|
|PG	|53%	|31 Mar 2017	|Rotten Tomatoes	|The Boss Baby|
|PG	|50/100	|31 Mar 2017|	Metacritic	|The Boss Baby|
|TV-PG|	5.2/10	|13 Sep 2019|	Internet Movie Database	|Tall Girl|

*Query Results*

We can see that each movie has multiple rows, one for each rating given to that movie.
