# UK House Prices

This dataset contains the price paid for houses sold in the UK from 2015 until 2022.
You can learn more about the dataset at [Price Paid Data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads)

## Prerequisites

To follow the code examples in this guide, you must [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) locally and [download recipes](/docs/pinot/recipes/#download-recipes).

## Navigate to recipe

1. If you haven't already, [download recipes](/docs/pinot/recipes/#download-recipes).
2. In terminal, go to the recipe by running the following command:
  ```bash
  cd pinot-recipes/recipes/house-prices-dataset
  ```

## Download data

The dataset contains `.csv` files with house sales from specific years.
You will need to download at least one of these ffiles from https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads#yearly-file and put it in the `raw` directory.

You'll then need to call `clean_csv.py` with the name of the CSV file in the `raw` directory.
For example, if you download the 2021 dataset, you'd run this command, passing in `pp-2021.csv`:

```bash
python clean_csv.py pp-2021.csv
```

The CSV file will have a header line appended to the front and will be written to the `data` directory.


## Launch Pinot Cluster

You can spin up a Pinot Cluster by running the following command:

```bash

docker compose up
```

This command will run a single instance of the Pinot Controller, Pinot Server, Pinot Broker, and Zookeeper. 
You can find the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/startreedata/pinot-recipes/blob/main/recipes/house-prices-dataset/docker-compose.yml) file on GitHub.

## Pinot Schema and Table

Now let's create a Pinot Schema and Table.

First, the schema:

```json
{
  "schemaName": "house_prices",
  "dimensionFieldSpecs": [
    {"name": "UniqueTransactionIdentifier", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "Postcode", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "PropertyType", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "OldNew", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "Duration", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "PAON", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "SAON", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "Street", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "Locality", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "TownCity", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "District", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "County", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "PPDCategoryType", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "RecordStatus", "dataType": "STRING"}
  ],
  "dateTimeFieldSpecs": [
    {
      "name": "TransferDate",
      "dataType": "TIMESTAMP",
      "format": "1:MILLISECONDS:EPOCH",
      "granularity": "1:MILLISECONDS"
    }
  ],
  "metricFieldSpecs": [{"name": "Price", "dataType": "INT"}]
}
```
*config/schema.json*

We'll also have the following table config:

```json
{
  "tableName": "house_prices",
  "tableType": "OFFLINE",
  "segmentsConfig": {
    "replication": 1,
    "schemaName": "house_prices",
    "timeColumnName": "TransferDate"
  },
  "tenants": {},
  "tableIndexConfig": {},
  "ingestionConfig": {
    "transformConfigs": [
      {
        "columnName": "TransferDate",
        "transformFunction": "FromDateTime(DateOfTransfer, 'YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm')"
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {}
}
```
*config/table.json*


You can create the table and schema by running the following command:`

```bash
docker run \
   --network houseprices \
   -v $PWD/config:/config \
   apachepinot/pinot:1.0.0 AddTable \
     -schemaFile /config/schema.json \
     -tableConfigFile /config/table.json \
     -controllerHost "pinot-controller-houseprices" \
    -exec
```


## Ingesting CSV files

We're going to use Pinot's SQL insert syntax to import the CSV files. 
Navigate to the [Pinot UI](http://localhost:9000) and click on `Query Console`
You can then run the following query to run the ingestion job:

```sql
SET taskName = 'houseprices-dataload';
SET input.fs.className = 'org.apache.pinot.spi.filesystem.LocalPinotFS';
SET includeFileNamePattern='glob:**/*.csv';
INSERT INTO house_prices 
FROM FILE 'file:///data/';
```

Wait a few minutes for the job to complete. You can check on the status by navigating to the [Minion Task Manager](http://localhost:9000/#/minion-task-manager) page.

## Querying the dataset

Once the data is loaded, we can run some queries.

We can find the highest average prices paid by county:

```sql
select County, avg(Price) AS averagePrice, max(Price) AS maxPrice, count(*) AS numberOfSales
from house_prices
group by County
order by averagePrice DESC
limit 10
```

| County                      |      averagePrice |      numberOfSales |
|:-----------------------|-------:|-------:|
| GREATER LONDON         | 820453 | 241466 |
| WINDSOR AND MAIDENHEAD | 713789 |   5637 |
| SURREY                 | 674173 |  47885 |
| BUCKINGHAMSHIRE        | 592569 |  21111 |
| HERTFORDSHIRE          | 562596 |  42077 |
| OXFORDSHIRE            | 553955 |  26880 |
| WOKINGHAM              | 530317 |   7072 |
| SLOUGH                 | 522438 |   3314 |
| BRIGHTON AND HOVE      | 518568 |  10847 |
| BRACKNELL FOREST       | 501640 |   4986 |

Or find the most expensive property sold by town/city in 2021:


```sql
select TownCity, County, avg(Price) AS averagePrice, mode(Price), 
       max(Price) AS maxPrice, 
       count(*) AS numberOfSales
from house_prices
WHERE year(TransferDate) = 2021
group by TownCity, County
order by maxPrice DESC
limit 10
```

| TownCity     | County             |   maxPrice |   numberOfSales|
