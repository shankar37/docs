<Callout type="info">In this guide you'll learn how to install Apache Pinot on your local machine.</Callout>

Pinot can be installed directly on your machine from a binary file or using the Brew package manager. It is also
available via Docker. Instructions for each option are described below:

## With Docker

1. To install Docker, see [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. To pull the Docker image onto your machine, run the following command:

 ```bash
    docker pull apachepinot/pinot:1.0.0
 ```

## With Brew

Pinot can also be installed on Mac OS using the Brew package manager. For instructions on installing Brew, see the [Brew
documentation](https://brew.sh/).

```js copy
brew install pinot
```

## With Launcher Scripts 

Download the latest binary release from [pinot.apache.org/download](https://pinot.apache.org/download/) or run the following command from the terminal:

###### Download Pinot
```bash
PINOT_VERSION=1.0.0
wget https://downloads.apache.org/pinot/apache-pinot-$PINOT_VERSION/apache-pinot-$PINOT_VERSION-bin.tar.gz
```


<Callout type="warning">
    Pinot requires JDK11 or higher (JDK16 is not yet supported).
</Callout>


Once you have the tar file:

###### Untar it
```bash
tar -zxvf apache-pinot-$PINOT_VERSION-bin.tar.gz
```

###### Navigate to directory containing launcher scripts
```bash
cd apache-pinot-$PINOT_VERSION-bin
```


## Next Steps

You've now got Pinot installed on your machine and the next step is to try it out.

* To see an example of all the Pinot components running in a single process with a pre-loaded dataset, see the [Quickstart](quick-start.mdx) guide.
* To create a local cluster, with each Pinot component running separately, see the [Create Cluster](create-cluster.md) guide.
