This guide will teach you how to create a Pinot Cluster in your local machine.

Apache Pinot is a distributed system made of different components, each performing a unique task while in operation. In the [Quickstart example](quick-start.mdx), we saw all these components deployed inside a single JVM (Java Virtual Machine). But, in
reality, Pinot components are deployed as separate runtimes to enable high scalability and fault tolerance.

A typical Pinot cluster consists of the following components:

- Zookeeper (not strictly a Pinot component, but Pinot depends on it)
- Pinot Controller
- Pinot Broker
- Pinot Server

When creating a cluster, these components must be configured and started separately.

Let’s start with Docker first.

## With Docker Compose ##

With Docker, we will spin up each component as a container. Rather than doing it individually, let’s create a Docker Compose project to bundle everything together.

<Callout>
  Before getting started, make sure that your Docker installation meets the minimum requirements.
We would recommend that you allocate 8 CPUs, 16GB of RAM, 4GB of swap, and 50 GB, but you can adjust this accordingly.
</Callout>

Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` and add the following content to it.

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: zookeeper:3.5.6
    hostname: zookeeper
    container_name: zookeeper
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000
    networks:
      - pinot-demo
  pinot-controller:
    image: apachepinot/pinot:1.0.0
    command: "StartController -zkAddress zookeeper:2181"
    container_name: "pinot-controller"
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    networks:
      - pinot-demo
  pinot-broker:
    image: apachepinot/pinot:1.0.0
    command: "StartBroker -zkAddress zookeeper:2181"
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: "pinot-broker"
    ports:
      - "8099:8099"
    depends_on:
      - pinot-controller
    networks:
      - pinot-demo
  pinot-server:
    image: apachepinot/pinot:1.0.0
    command: "StartServer -zkAddress zookeeper:2181"
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: "pinot-server"
    depends_on:
      - pinot-broker
    networks:
      - pinot-demo
networks:
  pinot-demo:
    name: pinot-demo
```

Here, we are using the `apachepinot/pinot:1.0.0` Docker image.

Start the stack by typing:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

That will bring up a collection of containers including Zookeeper, Kafka, Pinot Controller, Pinot Broker, and Pinot Server. 

Check their status by running:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```
## With Launcher Scripts ##

We can set up a Pinot cluster using the launcher scripts that come with the Pinot distribution. Here, each Pinot component will be started as a separate JVM.

First, download the Pinot distribution, unpack it, and navigate to the `bin` directory, as described in the [Installation Developer Guide](install-pinot.md#with-launcher-scripts).
Next we'll start up each of the components. 


<Callout>
  You'll need to run each of the commands below in a separate terminal window.
</Callout>

### Start Zookeeper ###

```bash
bin/pinot-admin.sh StartZookeeper
```
### Start Pinot Controller ###

```bash
bin/pinot-admin.sh StartController \
  -zkAddress localhost:2181
```

### Start Pinot Broker ###

```bash
bin/pinot-admin.sh StartBroker \
  -zkAddress localhost:2181
```

### Start Pinot Server ###

```bash
bin/pinot-admin.sh StartServer \
  -zkAddress localhost:2181
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've got Pinot running locally, it's time to see what it can do by ingesting some data.
